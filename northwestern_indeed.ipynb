Rather than increase head count for the Service Desk, they designated 1st and 2nd tier analysts. 1st tier gets the call and if they cannot resolve in 10 minutes, they must first announce the issue to the caller, then ask them if they would like to be transferred to a 'Long Call Technician'. If they say yes, they then had to be placed on hold while the 1st tier reaches out for an available 2nd tier. ,This, along with the fact that NWM literally will support anything the field reps bring into their offices, makes the average workday nearly unbearable.

Being an agent is like running your own business: there are no work hours, just hours to work. At the beginning, agents are living and breathing the company sales process until they hit their stride. For some, this may take a few years depending how they apply the leads process and control Seminars. The knowledge aspect of Company training is normally implemented in degrees and some agents graduate faster than others. The marketing and selling is dependent on the person. Management, I have noticed, with my time spent at New York Life is hit or miss depending on the manager (as with most places) and the fit. Usually turnover is very HIGH,  we should expect to see maybe 3 or 4 people stick with it in a training class of about 30 or so. This career is tough for the every day person, but if the right skill set is applied, agents find satisfaction and reward.'},\n",

       "  'column': 'Working at Northwestern Mutual was bad, it is a company for someone that is experienced and already has a book of business. ,REALLY hard to be successful unless you\\'re at the right environment. ,If you do not possess a \"start my own\" business mindset, you will NOT be successful. There is NO salary, ONLY commission based and bonus on performance. ,Training is 3 weeks. UNPAID. You have to cover all costs to get to and from the office if you\\'re commuting by mass transit. THEY WILL NOT PAY ANYTHING TO YOU OTHER THAN YOUR BUSINESS THAT YOU BRING IN!!!!,They will make you build a list of 200 names composed of friends, family, ex-coworkers and etc when you come in to train for them. Then they will teach you about their products and services as well as language. Then they will have you dial everyday to set up appointments in what they call \"prospecting day weekend\" where you will try to tell your friends and family what you do and then they will push you to sell them Life insurance and insurance products.,After you graduate from their training program they expect you to have minimum of 25 appointments PER week. Anything less you will be in danger of being let go. ,This is a opportunity for someone that has a large warm circle and is able to cold call (2-400 dials a day) to build a practice. ,This company wants you to sell LIFE INSURANCE!! It is NOT a financial services company. They tell you they are but they are only an insurance company and offer the most basic mutual funds. Nothing more.,So if you like to be an insurance salesman then this is perfect for you,, if not then stay away!,I was in the Farmingdale location. The people were cold, there was not any \"real\" help. The person dedicated to help me with the submitting of paperwork for policies to the home office, told me to do it on my own and had a nasty attitude at times. VERY unprofessional lady. ,When you start off, the Sr. Advisor will take HALF of your commission because they\"helped\" you sell. There is nothing you can do unless you do a case completely on your own and ON TOP of them taking half your money, your client they helped you with will ALSO become their client so any future sale you do, they will take half no matter what in the future: PYRAMID SCHEME.,Most of the time, your older advisors are REALLY busy with their own clients that it becomes difficult for you to start bc they cant come to your meetings. Several times i felt disrespected that advisors would cancel on a meeting with a client of ours because they \"didn\\'t feel\" like it would be a good case and you end up looking terrible to your client. ,They do not care about you and your business, they will help you once it is a big case so you better be able to attract whales as they say.,Lastly, after your first year they will make you pay monthly rent for your office, supplies, computer, marketing material, business cards ,software and anything you use that is theirs. To me that was a HUGE red flag.,You will be meeting with your managing director once a week on Monday and it will be a meeting basically to see how many calls you make and how much business you do. My meetings were terrible and at some point useless. It was all the same, no opportunity to learn and grow.,You are also expected to have 60 meetings minimum a month, or what they call 25 ahead, so every week you need 25 meetings. If you fail, you will be pushed out. They will not care too much for you other than tell you what you need to do to sell insurance. ,Lastly, NO MATTER what your client may need, the Sr Advisor WILL push Life insurance down the clients throat. Beware the people you work with because they will make or break your business.,In essence, i do not agree with the way NWM does business and runs its shop. A lot needs to change. I will recommend you stay away from this place. There are many better companies to work for out there. If you are comfortable with someone taking half your money in the beginning , feeling like a nuisance to senior advisors, having to share all of your early clients forever, like to cold call at least 200 times a day, having to push people to buy life insurance when they don\\'t need it and being a SALESMAN and paying for supplies, marketing material, rent on your office, laptop and etc as well as paying your own when attending conferences of the company then go ahead and work there. ,THAT is the reality of working at NWM. Don\\'t be deceived at the job interviews. They will not tell you half of this stuff until you realize how bad the business structure is 1 month in.'},\n",

In the beginning, it appeared to be a great place to work, based on the motivational speeches, stories of personal impact, and huge earnings potential. As a new financial representative you need to come in with a ton of contacts and money in the bank. You could go weeks and months without any income. You spend most of your day calling or having meeting with \"prospects\". There are a lot of daily/weekly/monthly training meetings with groups and leaders. At times there are almost too many meetings. In the beginning you are basically hounding your family, friends, and acquaintances to purchase life, disability, and long term care insurance from you. You also end up hounding those same people to provide you with more contacts to hound. You have certain productivity goals each day/week/month that revolve around phone calls and meetings. If you call enough people and set enough meetings you \"should\" get the expected number of new clients and lives. There is a minimum new client and lives goal that must be met by the 6 month mark. If you don\\'t meet that minimum you are encouraged to move on.  While you trying to get your business off the ground and generate income in your first 6 months, sometimes spending nights and weekends working, you are expected to study for/take multiple state insurance license tests and the 6/63 security license exams. The company does pay for you to get your first two states insurance licences as well as your 6/63.You, are required to have \"joint work\" prospect/client meetings with seasoned veterans and split the commission earned if the prospect/client decides to move forward with anything. Without your 6/63 license you can\\'t even talk financial planning and so your \"joint work partner\" takes the lead in all conversations. You also don\\'t earn commission on financials until you have your 6/63 license. The management team was great most of the time, offering many learning opportunities, but if you are not cutting it, they can be harsh and ultimately move on from you. It appears that only 1/100 new financial representatives make it past 6 months. They are always recruiting for and trying to fill open positions. Some people make it a week or two, others a month or two, some make 3-6 months, but very few make it past 6 months. The \"college intern program\" is where most of the successful financial representatives come from. They get catered too and are set up for success.

Also, it had a solid corporate culture where employees felt valued and supported. Though, it had an antiquated infrastructure, systems, processes and staff. In the past decade, the company has transformed with the intention of properly aligning the business with the changing financial industry. This includes increased digital accessibility of information and a more wholistic offering of financial security beyond the flagship life insurance products. Conceptually, this transformation sounded like something I wanted and did choose to rally behind. Though, it quickly became apparent that the list of cons outweighed the pros. There was a significant loss in strong leadership which had enterprise-wide impacts including lack of strategic vision, significant loss in company-wide, departmental and team communication and collaboration. There was an overwhelming and continued failure in properly and respectfully managing team and organizational restructuring (staffing loss/gain) resulting in an immense amount of employee fear, distrust and overall inefficiency. Looking back, I recall how the company felt slow moving due to said outdated items. Though, now the company feels slow moving due to an overwhelming amount of chaos, lack of leadership strength and collaboration. It's understandable that achieving massive change at a large corporation would involve some chaos and/or mess, but I feel that while the company pursues their transformation they have negatively, impacted the brand loyalty and trust of their client base to perhaps a detrimental degree.\"},\n",

A typical day at Northwestern Mutual consists of a training and development meeting lead by the Chief Development Officer. This is to review activity and productivity to assure our team is remaining on track. I would then sit down with my mentor and review my specific numbers for the prior week and also for the week ahead of me. This is to make sure my numbers align with my weekly and monthly goals. After my training and development, I begin to dial the phone and set meetings. My personal goal is to dial 20 people a day, and also set 5 meetings a day. That brings me to 25 meetings ahead each week. After my phoning, I attend my meetings I have set for that day. ,The workplace culture is incredible. The people at Northwestern Mutual are always willing to help. I have made life long friends within my company. The culture of Northwestern Mutual consists of hard working individuals that truly have each and every one of their clients best interest at heart. ,The hardest part about my job is selling a product that most people do not necessarily want to think about purchasing. This is because Life and Disability insurance benefits are mostly exercised in unfortunate circumstances. As a financial representative, it is my job to explain to a client the importance of protecting assets along with their family in the event of a death or disability, and then simply encouraging clients to want to own these products. ,The, most enjoyable aspect of my job is knowing I am truly helping people create a financial plan to best suit their wants and needs. I have been able to help many people I love and care about begin planning for their futures in the most efficient ways possible. I have also truly enjoyed learning more about asset management and investment based planning. I have learned so much already about finance and have been taught by the best team out there!'},\n",

That's where actual associates come in, who go in with you on prospective clients.

      "Again, this isn't, every team, nor is this a drawback per se, but for those who weren't raised in that faith tradition or for those with more progressive leanings, the emphasis on faith and Christian practices can be jarring and even off-putting.,- Assistant or associate financial reps (AFRs) aren't technically employees of NM; they're employees of the financial representatives (FRs) who hire them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The impact of this is that your employing FR may or may not have the means or desire to offer you the compensation you need, nor is there a lot of consistency between teams' compensation practices that you can look to in order to bolster your case for getting more than you're offered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This also means that AFRs aren't extended the opportunity to participate in the company's health care or retirement plans - the establishment of these plans are, again up to your individual employer.,- While most FRs offer bonuses and salary increases to their teams based on the achievement of annual performance goals, there's not a lot of positional advancement as an AFR.\n",

       "'Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. A typical day is very busy, more than half of the day are on the phones. Sometimes lunch and breaks had to be missed.  Training could use improvement. Northwestern <mutual tiene un buen producto pero la sucursal adonde trabaje tiene una cultura muy mala. It\\'s good if you want commission only and no base salary.  The training is sub par and you\\'re motivated to dial constantly.  The work culture was the best part of being there. I really enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual. They make sure that the employees are well taken care of, it was a fast paced environment, and I was able to be challenged and grow in my professional knowledge. Definitely hard work,  but such amazing people. An unbelievable opportunity for people looking to be supported and mentored. Best work culture I can imagine. My job here was pretty simple once I knew how to do everything, which was achievable on the first day. It was a good place to start working since there wasn\\'t too much stress on you to get your work done extremely fast. They let me work at my own pace and left me to do my work as long as I did it well. The people there that I met were kind and great people and a joy to be around. Overall, not a bad place to work.  Good work/life balance. Customer focus but products are quite expensive. A good place for a recent college grad. Average compensation. My time at Northwestern Mutual taught me what it was like to work in fast paced competitive work environment. The workplace culture is largely determined by the representative that you work under and the specific elements of your job. Northwestern Mutual is full of driven, educated individuals who have a clear goal in mind. Even though the company does not provide personal benefits for employees the commission for financial advisers is great. Home office has all the benefits you could ask for Lots of training and generally good corporate atmosphere. If you work in a field office, your benefits and the whole workplace experience depends on your local management. Benefits, that are very expensive, just started to be offered and for a company famous for great life insurance and disability insurance, it\\'s not offered as a group benefit! You can buy a plan of course, and get a discount but not as low as group rates. It\\'s insane. Compensation varies depending on management as well. I do not get commissions even though I am a client-facing advisor. My practice manager gives a bonus once a year which is nowhere near what should be paid...Generally speaking, this company doesn\\'t tolerate the prima donna terrorists that others in the financial industry tolerate from high producers so that\\'s a plus. They instill the highest standards on their agents, advisors and financial planners. Hard working atmosphere that emphasized the importance of team building as well as enjoying the work place. Work ethic and mission is what drives the people at Northwestern I have had a positive experience working at Northwestern Mutual. The company offers a free lunch that is really good. The benefits regarding the 401K match and health are also good. Loved the flexible hours, on-going coaching was a plus, I liked meeting new potential clients and helping current ones. The work environment is super professional and I felt welcomed. The team that I was surrounded with was awesome. Everybody was willing to go the extra mile for their co-workers. It pushed me to get out of my comfort zone. Overall good company to work for with great advancement opportunity in a number of areas.  Only thing that was lacking was extensive sales training for those who may have financial skills, but lack some of the sales-oriented background. I had to deal with technical recruiter Cody Cox. He never responded even afer serveral emails and phone class once after offer letter. ,We dont know if we are going to join or what are next step. There was no other option at that time, so had to join the company.,I feel company reputation is lost because of such team.,Thx This Top 10 nationally ranked internship program required a two-week training program to provide necessary business skills to be a successful intern, as well as preparation for state insurance licensing exams. Important skills acquired during this program include: language, marketing, client building, finance, phoning, prospecting, and presenting. All the skills learned were focused towards being a more successful business individual, but more specifically, a successful salesperson.,•\\tParticipated in weekly meetings to build skills, analyze and assess intern performance.,•\\tShadowed full-time representatives on client meetings.,•\\tScheduled & met with 12-15 clients weekly.,•\\t*Surrendered internship to seek other opportunities. A typical day included calling 25 people I knew and trying to get them to meet up with me so I could sell them Life Insurance. I learned a lot about having faith in yourself, and overcoming objection. Management was supportive and always positive. The culture was great, and my peers always watched out for me. The hardest part of the job was the commission based pay and the selling to my friends. The most enjoyable part was the freedom in scheduling. Its alright nothing that really gets you moving every morning as you have to make your own meetings and basically run your own company with no experience Great company with morals and values. Very little room to advance and grow. Poor management system. Focused on gossiping and rumors. Puts the financial reps needs before the support staff. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Taking this position requires getting up every day to talk to new potential clients. Be prepared to be turned down 90% of the time. It can be very rewarding once you figure out your selling strategy. Great place to intern but was very difficult to keep up with if you are commuting. You can only use the computers in the office so you must be in the office to do work. Most days consist of meeting with clients and developing/presenting plans. You must find all of your own clients which can be difficult if you are young or not from the area. They mostly just want you to sell to your family. You don\\'t get paid if you don\\'t hit your benchmark. All sales are split with partners. Local office is lacking leadership, direction and vision. New employees are set up to fail. The training and mentoring structure is very overbearing, rude and ineffective. Northwestern Mutual is a great corporate citizen that is doing an excellent job investing in Milwaukee. However, while job security was once a staple of the company, this is no longer the case. Since the purchase of LearnVest in 2015, the vision of the company has become less clear. As a result, several layoffs have occurred and several key executives have left. While the company has an admirable goal of creating an exceptional client experience driven by financial planning, the ongoing layoffs leave employees wondering who\\'s next and key work for driving an exceptional client experience is slow to get done. Northwestern Mutual is well aware that there is a lot of disruption occurring in the financial services industry and is trying to figure out how best to deal with it. This was great experience.  I worked with a fantastic Adviser who had been there for 20 plus years. ,Very nice office.  Good atmosphere.  I would recommend to anyone looking. All they ask you to make calls and nothing else. Not at all a suitable job if you are an introvert. The salary they provide to the interns does not even cover weekly expenses. I learned a lot but wasn\\'t paid much to be an assistant. Being a representative is great; the company worships their representatives. Assistants are rarely recognized for their effort by the company in general, so you really need to work for a high grossing rep for your salary to compensate for the lack of recognition. That being said, I\\'m very glad I worked there. You will learn everything about personal finance. Must give most of your time/life early in career to be able to succeed. Culture was competitive between individuals. Management pick favorites and focused on their development. Lack of culture in the office makes it difficult to succeed. Very little interaction with others. No excitement or enjoyment to go to work on a daily basis. All compensation is based on commission and bonuses so the stress level in the office was above average. The people who worked there are kind, encouraging, and always looking for ways to help each other night. Each week there were multiple staff bonding events, birthday emails, and free food. Northwestern Mutual is an amazing company. I would without a doubt recommend  people to work there. The culture and atmosphere at the office I was which was coral gables was amazing. The thing that was hard for me was the fact you had to collect names from friends and family in order to go out and sell. On top of that you had to go out with a senior advisor and split commission on everything in your first year. I drove around a lot and didn’t close anything in my first three months. If you have lots of money saved up then go for it because you can make a lot of money. If you don’t I would not advise you take this job. Northwestern Mutual is an amazing company that puts its clients interest first and foremost. The advisers receive phenomenal training upon joining the company as well as mentoring/training along the way. A typical day in the office consisted of meeting with my staff, making dials, and then meeting clients or potential clients in person or over the phone. The manager in our office was extremely knowledgeable and always went out of his way to ensure we were doing the right thing. The hardest part of the job was seeing how many new reps failed out of the business. More than 90% of new reps don\\'t make it past the first  months, but I genuinely think that most of them don\\'t want to put in the required effort. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing clients take action on their personal and financial goals and then see their growth throughout the years of working together. They are a good company to work for. My personal management was a very poor situation, others in the company were delightful. I learned a lot about my own personal finances. At a different time in my career this could have been a great opportunity.  Timing was just off.  People were helpful to a degree, but at a certain point in my tenure the help changed to pressure. Northwestern Mutual was  great place to learn how to sell effectively. Moreover, you had to be self motivated and earn your own money rather than sit back and let salary come to you. Northwestern gives you world class training. They expect world class performance.  Great leadership that supports you very well from both a resource and mindset standpoint. The culture was amazing.  I was the first person the clients would see and they were absolutely wonderful. I learned alot about the company and the specifics of Life Insurance. They underpay and don’t offer any growth opportunities. Along with this, there is an absence of loyalty. Great products, though. I hated every moment of working there, but they offer great financial services The internship program was very unorganized. I found it to be a waste of time and it is not helpful to a career in finance. I would not recommend the program. I have been with this company for three years and I already know this is the company I\\'ll be with when i retire.,It\\'s tough to be in sales, especially if you come from a not-so-great market, but the opportunities are endless. I was not so great at sales, but learned enough about the company that I was able to land in a staff position and I love every day of it.,My day runs 7:30-4:30 with a lunch hour, but I have the opportunity to alter my hours if I want to. I basically created this position and I\\'m able to bring up changes that will be seriously considered if needed.,I\\'ve learned more about the finance industry than I ever imagined, and training or updates are given multiple times every week.,The management is friendly, but expectant. They want everyone to be happy and productive, and they balance both well.,The culture is easy-going, but everyone enjoys friendly competition to keep productivity high.,The hardest part of the job is staying motivated to continue doing the things that make one successful--which is to habitually do the things that unsuccessful people don\\'t want to do.,The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the community impact we make on peoples\\' lives and the lives of the other staff and advisors. It\\'s a dream to be able to share that with others. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. This job taught me a lot in the field of job culture. Advisors were willing to help and had many tips on how to succeed not only within the company, but they helped you develop skills that will help in any future employment. If you don\\'t care about learning actual financial advisor skills and want to just sell insurance.  This is your place.  If not, I\\'d highly advise going elsewhere. This was a temporary position until I found full-time employment that allowed me to return to school. I feel very impartial to the job and my experiences there. This job is based on your contacts and setting meetings. You msut be personable and build a contact listing with as many people as possible. Also the people must fit the economic profile of the contacts  you will be building. Keep that in mind. There is a great opportunity to have an amazing life style once you make it past a certain amount of years as a Rep. Get used to relying on friends and family at first to build your market. Not a bad work environment but it can be really difficult without any base pay. They do help you get your licenses if you stay with them but that can be difficult because of the hours you need. Everyone really cares about their clients.  Good work life balance.  People take pride in working for the company.  I enjoy working with my co-workers. Was a lot to take in at first, but overall was very well-structured and taught a lot of essential skills to becoming an expert in the life insurance space. You need to either still live at home or have a year salary in the bank in order to keep your mind on the job rather than the impending doom of not paying bills.  no leads given and they want you to call everyone you know and make them clients. then, hopefully you can get referrals from there to keep the business going. Working at NML is on a commission only basis and this allows one to make as much or as little as you want. You have the freedom to attend soccer games with your children and golf when you want to but this also offers the freedom to go broke if you do not work hard enough. I would highly recommend this career to anyone seeking to build their own business. They only need you for the first 5 years. Management doesn\\'t get paid on Reps after 5 years. They will try and convince you to enter the leadership program and recruit your friends so they can milk them for their contacts. You will sign a non-compete/ non-disclosure that keeps you from working with those contacts you made clients while with the company. During this non-compete window, they will have other reps under 5 years contact those clients, telling them you are no longer with the company and try and sell them something that\\'s completely unnecessary to make the commission and overrides. It\\'s a mess and management will tell you anything they can to make you think they want you there for the long term. I have worked with several organizations over my life and this one was by far the worst decision I have ever made. good work life balance and potential for good mentorship opportunities, however is based on commission so depending on where you are may not be the most ideal Wasted almost 4 years here holding every license my rep had making peanuts. Didn’t even have the benefits that we push for our clients. Wanted to look for another position within the company and was told I had to announce it to my rep which gave him the opportunity to fire me first because of course, who wants to keep an employee once they’re telling you they’d like to leave? I’m sure working in Milwaukee is great but I’d never recommend working for a private rep doing all their work watching them taking home a couple hundred thousand while you’re lucky to bring in $40k. It’s a joke. Empty promises. Don\\'t believe the salary expectations. Maybe, at 5-10 years in, you\\'ll be at 60k MAYBE but the management team plays favorites and to get to a sustainable level of income expect to work all evenings and weekends and spam call your close friends. NM is a well respected company but in deep trouble. The world of finance has changed and NW is struggling to adapt. Very insular culture. Few people are empowered to make change. Lots of big titles floating the halls but few dare challenge the status quo or drive change.  Some tired senior leaders have been forced out, but they have been replaced with defenders of the status quo. The company is entirely wed to permanent life insurance and can live off its legacy financial strength for years. But Americans are abandoning PLI and NW has no answer for that other than doubling down a new planning experience tool that does nothing really to change the selling dynamic for financial reps who are the company’s lifeblood. My experience with this company was horrible! The first month or two are  great! The trainers are weird and mildly crazy. They want to know your business. Everyone is extremely unprofessional. People gossip too much and if you plan on keeping to yourself don’t! They will treat you like an outsider!! The job was not explained well you will be doing much more than expected. Run please! You will hate the work environment and the people.  I put in my two weeks notice after 6 months! Very micromanaged! The turnover rate is high. One of the trainers made unprofessional comments. My manager was extremely unprofessional. It was a big mess save yourself a headache and run from this call center. My boss was very type A, I had the worst anxiety going to work.  The building is very high school like, people talk about one another and don\\'t socialize outside of work. My college financial internship position at Northwestern Mutual was a great experience. I learned what it takes to operate successfully as a financial representative. This part-time experience was a great fit for my schedule as a full-time university student. Management was always willing to help me succeed and I was placed with a great mentor. Throughout the internship, I struggled to build my client base organically without having access to leads.  I enjoyed getting to know the company culture and helping clients reach their financial goals. All dependent on the advisor you work for; it can make or break your experience with the company.,The company has strong values and it\\'s advisors and their staff work to uphold them each day. You are not provided with any leads. Understand what that means. It\\'s all on you. Even the sales courses they pay for mean nothing to you if you don\\'t have quality prospects. I have known more than 1 or 2 people who followed the NM system and did everything the trainings said to do and STILL could not make this career work. I\\'m talking, their bosses analyzed every inch of how they were doing things and even they could not figure out why the sales were not coming in. ,For those who have 6-12 months to not need any money, this could be great, but the commission-only pay structure is not sustainable for the vast majority of people. Even some financial representatives who were able to do well for a long time (18-36 months) found themselves with a stalled business as they ran out of leads. ,If you happen to be connected with all sorts of high-earning or high net worth people who you can convince need what you\\'re selling (but remember a lot of those people will already have it since they\\'re responsible, so you\\'ll be trying to convince them to buy more of what they already have), sure, you can make quite a bit of money--as long as they don\\'t change their mind within 12 months and you have to pay back the commission. ,You pay for ALL your own expenses (even faxing and copying at the office) and an assistant, which will be necessary, even if just part time, once you start to have more appointments. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. This is a tough career but can be very rewarding. If you\\'re willing to take on a commissioned position and bet on yourself to put in the long hours of work to get your business up and off the ground then this job is for you. reorganization of groups and departments happens frequently, causing work disruption.  co-workers are among the best I have worked with.  management is not very transparent. Fantastic work culture. Extremely tough company to work for but the culture is great and has a family feel to it. Made many great friends there and everyone is very supportive. This was at convergys and the project ended.pretty abruptly. This thong wants me to type 50 characters but there really isnt 50 characters worth of stuff to type so here\\'s some random nonsense. Not the best place to start as they do not pay you hourly. They pay by the contract signed. This is hard to stay in the game when you are not pushed by a salery. There is an inordinate amount of change going on right now. Employee morale is suffering. The company has been around for 160+ years so it’s likely not going anywhere. They have recently downsized mainly older workers in favor of hiring younger and from the outside. Seems like focus is more on tech than product fundamentals. The home office experience is completely different than being in a sales position or field office. Everyone in the office is labeled as a winner or a loser. The managing partner would routinely call underperforming new people \"bottom feeders\". It was a terrible work environment. There were many hard working high achievers, but only the very top would be recognized. The mentorship program is deplorable. The mentor assigned to me was never prepared for our weekly meetings and instead just talked about the plans he and his wife had, or would go through role playing scenarios and interrupt me throughout with comments like, \"No, that\\'s stupid, why would you say that?\" This role playing berating would also occur in new advisor training. Northwestern Mutual is a meat-grinder, chewing up hard workers and spitting out the bloody pulp. Upon starting at NWM, you will be asked for a list of 200 friends and family. That is then your book of business, and you are expected to hustle family and friends from high-school and college. While this approach works for some, it was not ideal for me. Very little help in acquiring new leads besides telling employees to get referrals. I may have a bit of a biased opinion only because I came into the business at such a young age. The opportunity this career can bring is unlimited. However, you HAVE to be willing to put yourself in uncomfortable situations. The older you are, the easier it will be because you will have built up more legit connections to call on when you start. Good place to work right out of college ,Flexible hours and schedule ,Good place to work for a mother without having the restrictions of an 8-5,I liked being able to set my own hours. The product is good but the job is 100% sales focused. Very aggressive sales oriented people and very high turnover. Its currently listed and one of the best opportunities in the country but its certainly not for everyone. Great workplace culture. Everyone is there to help each other and nobody wants to see anyone suffer. Great culture with positive vibe and great education Northwestern Mutual, a corporate environment where attention to detail was essential when managing client files and proofreading important financial information. NM is a wonderful company and the culture there is one of support and growth. The potential for growth is only as limited as one\\'s willingness to work. Great company background. Most days are spent in the office making calls and setting meetings. if you are not making calls then you are out on meetings. Hardest part of the Job is networking an finding a good client base to go off of. I enjoyed the freedom of being able to leave the office whenever to go on meetings. Low pay for the skills and licenses required to do the job. Micro-management that has terrible communication skills. It did have health benefits but with really high deductible. Co-workers were nice people, but often inappropriate. A typical day at work involved meeting with clients, phone calls, scheduling, and other facets of running a business.  I learned a lot about sales as well as how to properly plan for clients and their needs.  Management was great, always allowed for bonuses and other compensation incentives.  Workplace culture was great, you can have a lot of different people from different backgrounds just absolutely crushing it and you feed off of that energy.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with rejection as well as prospecting.  Getting new people to call is the number one driver of this business. , Most enjoyable part of the job is when people actually take you up on your recommendations and trust you as their advisor.  Overall it was a very good company to work for and I enjoyed working there very much. The overall structure of the company has changed a lot in recent years, mostly in negative ways. Lots of job cuts of employees who had been there for decades. They seem to care about the company making money more than how they treat their employees. It was a well-paying job after working at a non-profit. I was able to move into my first apartment which only cost $500 at the time and my roommate was never around. Perfect.,The job was pretty simple. I managed the General Agent\\'s daily schedule and monthly calendar. I had a way with computers and was granted a Technical Coordinator title and responsibilities and supported about 55 people. I was even sent out to the head office in Milwaukee for additional training in the Technical Coordinator role.,I was also in charge of the office supplies storage and ordering. I started with the internship with Northwestern Mutual as was involved for 2 years. I went full time after that and LOVE what I do as a financial advisor. I truly care about my clients and love the impact I create in the community. I have the ability to build my business to be anything I want it to be while providing an incredible life style for my family. Highly recommended. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. The first couples weeks will seem like the dream job to have but soon after you will discover that they treat people different depending on if they like you and how much of your personal business you share during one on ones with managers. Training process with the coaches is horrendous. They literally allow you to fail multiple calls and are completely useless. They are not up to par like other fortune 500 companies Ive worked for. Extremely cheap when doing thing for their employees. Parking is 15 minutes away from the door. So leaving to get lunch is slim to none. The free food made me sick most of the time due to them serving the same entrees for a week straight and they are completely unsanitary. Worse company I ever worked for and to think I turned down a better offer for them makes it worse. The pay is not worth the stress or the amount of work they add on you. Do do it, RUN!!!! This mainly applies to BILLING & PAYMENTS. Some other areas may not be as bad. Northwestern Mutual is a staple in the finance industry. This is a good company with a very flexible and tailored internship program. It is very hands on. Great opportunity, but it takes a special touch to manage building trust in the market at the rate necessary to sustain income. I would it difficult to manage the stress of learning new business, managing clients, and the delayed gratification of 100% commission compensation. I would have stayed if circumstances were different. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Northwestern Mutual and only left due to a necessary relocation.  The career advancement possibilities are amazing if you are willing to study and take advantage of them. A typical day at work consists of reaching out  to people who I know personally or networked with to set a meeting and get them to utilize life insurance and disability income insurance to help them and their family achieve financial security. The culture was great, high energy individuals. The hardest part of the job was running your own financial practice while the most enjoyable part was definitely the work in general. You meant something to people and were very important to families and businesses. You were highly valued everyday. Superior firm to other risk management providers. Excellent in every category possible: training, management, resources, etc. Hardest part: getting off the ground due the nature of the work and commission only payment I don\\'t want to take the time to do this. I\\'m not sure why i am required to. Just filling characters so this will leave me alone. Should be done now!! The unfortunate truth is that you are being evaluated behind your back, not to you directly. The \"office manager\" needs classes on how to manage. The person that trained for this position did not do so in a cohesive style, it was all mixed mash and up to you to figure out where a particular task \"fits\". Very disappointed. I had the best supervisors at Northwestern Mutual.  They work with me to achieve my goals on the job.  I worked at Northwestern for a year and a half back 2003. I enjoyed working here and learning how to carry myself professionally. The mentors here also taught me a lot about myself and helped me with my confidence. Selling insurance with the opportunity to turn it into a financial planning position. You get out of the opportunity what you put into it. Hard work but can pay off. Overall the company has a good corporate culture. There are mentor programs and development sessions that focus on your growth. For those whose passion is advising people on their financial health this is a good company to pursue your career in. Typical sales role with atypical sales job. a lot of impact but you have to work really hard to earn what you want to earn. Overall i enjoyed my experience there. Your day centers around meeting with clients, building a financial plan for them and networking.The job is mainly sales, but if you like talking to people and finances it is a great place to work. NWM is a wonderful company if you’re fit for the corporate lifestyle and journey. They offer so much to their employees and truly are dedicated to their clients just as they are their people. It’s provided a lot of good experience in getting your foot into the door to corporate America, but it is not for everyone. This job was very tough. It is 100% commission so if you are not making 50 dials a day, you will most likely not get paid. If there was salary plus commission it would be much better. I came into the summer financial representative program expecting it to be a proper finance program. Unfortunately, the majority of your time consists of trying to sell your family and friends life insurance they don\\'t need, and then cold calling businesses and trying to do the same. If you\\'re just looking for something to put on a resume, this is fine, but if you\\'re looking to learn skills and have an experience that will actually be valuable, don\\'t waste your time here. I did not learn much from NWM. They were not willing to train and I had never been in the financial world before. The team I was on pulled me from my current job to use my linked in contacts for recruitment purposes but did not tell me that when they brought me over.I felt very awkward reaching out to folks on linked in to get them to come in and interview for NWM. A basic day consisting of meeting with your mentor to review goals, making cold calls and meeting as a group. Sometimes there would be travel to a potential client to pitch to them. I learned communication skills, developed a thick skin, and gained a very solid foundation of knowledge of the industry. The workplace culture was nothing to write home about -  I was one of two female interns in a class of 20 that summer. The hardest part of the job was continually generating leads and actually getting someone to agree to meet with you. The most enjoyable part of the job was gaining an understanding of how incredibly important financial planning, life insurance etc. is for all of us. Young people, as well as not so young people, tend to think life insurance isn\\'t necessary; they are healthy so why spend more money? The younger and healthier you are the better policy and rate you are able to lockdown, and the more you are able to do with that investment. Talk to an agent to figure out more! Working at Northwestern Mutual is like working on a team. There is a level of independence on completing the workload but you also work alongside a financial representative, sometimes multiple. I learned quite a bit about the importance of financial stability and steps to take to get there. I was shown how to analyze financial portfolios to best outfit clients with how they should invest their money for the long term. Management is solely based on the financial representative you work for but overall Northwestern Mutual has technology and tools that everyone uses throughout the company to assist their clients. The workplace culture was friendly and employees tend to collaborate with one another to make sure a financial portfolio is best suited for the client at hand. The hardest part of the job was balancing the workload between prospective investors, current investors, and veteran investors, all of which had different deadlines at different times of the year. The most enjoyable part of the job was attending the numerous conferences that helped advance everyone\\'s career. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. NM as a company is great. Good products and services. The office culture is interesting... fun, but really inappropriate for a professional office setting. Management are poor communicators and expect a lot for little compensation. There\\'s no employee handbook or set policies and expectations are not really voiced, so they can let you go at any time for little reason. Lots of turn around. They do offer benefits but not the best. This was enjoyable summer internship that brought me through the everyday life of people working in the finance industry. I enjoyed being able to see people firsthand and shadow their work ethics. You must be seriously motivated to grow your own business. You are solely responsible for prospecting and continuing to provide your own leads. You are on your own but this can be amazing for the right person Great job that requires you to work an existing network or build a network. Great for folks that like flexibility, like working out of coffee shops and like helping people make the best financial choices for themselves and their families. The Newport Network office provides excellent training for interns and career changers. Process, workflow and expectations are addressed upfront as well as continuous follow up with production and support to help realize company requirements and the reps financial goals.,Must have 3-6 months of expenses saved to survive the first few months or it will be extremely stressful financially, I learned about financial planning and build up investment portfolio for clients. The working culture is good, everyone is very willing to help you and train you. They have good training program. This is a really amazing to job to get your foot in the door of the business world.The culture is unlike any other and you really do get to determine your pay. The more meetings you set, the more money you will make. A staff role at Northwestern Mutual is good for your first job, but there isn\\'t much room for growth beyond that. Compensation is horrible and there are nonexistent perks. This is only for staff roles, the financial advisors have autonomy, advancement, and better income opportunities. Tough Career to get of the ground, If looking for a career that will start you out in debt but eventually get you to be a high net worth individual this is it. Loved this job, wish I had been able to continue working there. I was laid off due to situations out of my control but the company gave me a lot of freedom, responsibility and room for growth. This job is what you make of it. Your success and failures rest on your motivation to set meetings to sell product which can be difficult if you do not believe in the mission. While it may be difficult, it can be rewarding knowing the product in which Northwestern provides is of the best quality. While you are your own boss, there are standards and metrics in which you need to do. The better you perform on the standards the better your results will be. This maybe difficult for those who are not self motivators as there is no one to watch your back and keep you in check. Responsible for the handling, processing, and servicing of client’s branch transactions in a prompt, efficient, and accurate manner. Daily tasks consist of but not limited to processing customer deposits, withdrawals, and payments, opening/closing accounts, and setting up pay roll deductions I worked as executive assistant to the Managing Director in recruiting for 3 yrs before taking on the roll of Associate Financial Representative which utilized my security and insurance licenses.,It is a younger culture of budding professionals. Finding and molding talent was enjoyable. For a company that does financial planning and insurance, there were to benefits other than paid vacation days. No health insurance. It was difficult to retain administrative employees without offering healthcare benefits or a retirement plan. Need to have a build your own business attitude. Can\\'t be afraid to talk to people. This type of work was very relationship based. You are asking questions many people don\\'t feel like talking about. wonderful company, healthy work/life balance, must be self-starter and driven to be successful, financial advisor role is difficult, must be well connected with background in sales. Enjoyed the people I worked with. Management can be helpful if you have a good supportive leader. Didn\\'t make much money but the experience helped in other jobs. This career is very tough to do it, however it very doable if you put in the effort. Management is awesome and everyone is very willing to help you succeed. Simply put, you get out what you put in. You are running your own office. Leadership is energetic and fun. They work hard and play hard. Excellent attention to detail and care for clients and staff. Philanthropic opportunities are encouraged The Service Desk is very fast paced and allows you to get experience on various hardware and software platforms.,The most difficult aspect of the job, is figuring out where to look for information to do your job. They use HPSM for their ticketing system.,It contains a database of incident fixes and can be a nightmare to search in. ,They implemented a new system just before I left that made the job very frustrating. Rather than increase head count for the Service Desk, they designated 1st and 2nd tier analysts. 1st tier gets the call and if they cannot resolve in 10 minutes, they must first announce the issue to the caller, then ask them if they would like to be transferred to a \\'Long Call Technician\\'. If they say yes, they then had to be placed on hold while the 1st tier reaches out for an available 2nd tier. ,This, along with the fact that NWM literally will support anything the field reps bring into their offices, makes the average workday nearly unbearable. This all would be easier to deal with if they compensated accordingly, but sadly they do not. The training process is extensive when you are first hired and they make sure that you are knowledgeable about insurance products and procedures before anything else.  A typical day started with making phone calls trying to make appointments and when there were meetings scheduled conference rooms were available for those that do not have an office.  As this is basically a sales job, it was difficult to plan your meetings between 9-5 so many days you have to wait for your clients to get home from work to be able to schedule the meetings.  The job was very enjoyable however, the people are friendly and want you to succeed and when a client acts on the plan it is very rewarding to know that you are helping someone. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. I absolutely love working for Northwestern Mutual! The pay and hours are great. Management is very supportive. I feel like my voice is heard. Upper management are very friendly. There are many opportunities and activities to help you de stress. There’s an on-site health clinic. It’s just awesome! Good. I thought that the company did the right things and valued their employees. I think that working at NWM was an overall positive experience that I am glad I went through. Great company. Your success falls upon who you know, as with anything in life. Great opportunity, great people. Take advantage of people around you that are successful and learn from them. it was a fun job i worked there as an intern in was on park ave in nyc,definitely a great learning experience.,if you are interested in selling life insurance or becoming a financial advisor i think its a great place to work At the beginning everything seems great and that they aren\\'t using just for your leads to people. But, in the end they are just using you for your leads, they don\\'t have a sustainable training program if you don\\'t have the market. Great goals for every team, many can seem sales focused, but that is a small part of the day. The management is focused on growth for the company overall and inclusion, but compensation and free reign of powerful people make this company hard to work for. 100% commission is not feasible for me as a family of five depends on me.  Not sure why I am being asked to review my company, but am looking for a more local, stable environment. There is a lot of drama and gossip that exists. Bonuses were not as much as originally explained.  Frustration with training and assistance from co-workers. This creates the need to figure things out as you go along Great place to work, great benefits and casual environment.  Management was very receptive to new ideas to streamline processes.  Other staff helped me to earn my Iowa Insurance Producers license I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the environment here. They made it easy to come to work every day with a good attitude. I also really liked the travel options. Company is in the middle of a transformation and it shows.  There is a sort of identity crisis around the Corporate culture.  They are trying to do too much all at once (and they don\\'t know if they want to be an insurance company, a wealth management company, an innovative tech lab or some sort of \"disruptor\" in the financial services industry); they claim to be all of these at the same time.  One big negative is the sales pressure for Advisory Services and Permanent Life Insurance for employees, even if you don\\'t need those products. If all offices are similar to the one I was in, be prepared to constantly be asking questions. There is a lack of transparency in terms of aspects you are just expected to have known/learned right out the gate without any heads up. It was quite a learning experience. Self-determination is key to be successful in this company, but also you have to consider how close you are to your warm market when entering the field. This career will either make or break you. It also taught me how to cope with rejection. Northwestern Mutual is a successful company nationwide. There is room to learn and develop yourself as a broker. As long as you soak in all of the knowledge and skills you will have a chance to produce. Productive and family oriented workplace.,Great work/family balance,Excellent opportunity to grow,State of the art training,Unlimited opportunity of earnings A typical day day as an Investment Operations Assistant starts out inputting stock/wire trades and gathering the multiple deposits for the day.  All work is time sensitive and confidential.  There are days where millions in funds are delivered to up to 3 banks on the lunchbreak. This job was a great opportunity to meet people, as well as explore options to better my future through investments. all of those things are super good here at northwestern mutual. I love my job, it is amazing, it is so fun. I think its the best job in the whole world. I moved to NM when I wanted to get out of a sales role with the previous positions.  They were willing to work with me to obtain the additional licensing needed to move into their open position Great flexible job work as an intern along with other financial advisors. Attended weekly meeting with team. also made calls and meetings weekly with other interns,. You will need financial help to make it in the first few years in this business. If you make it through the rough beginning you will be amazed at your success. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Unfortunately there is currently no visible leadership.,There is no communication.,The office culture is slowly being destroyed which has lead to incredibly low morale. Strong coaching and mentoring.  Just follow the steps and advice given to you, and you will succeed in this business.  You must be very dedicated and motivated. Wonderful place to work and learn. Great mentors, coworkers that become family, and unlimited income potential. If you have the drive and work ethic, you have all the resources here to succeed. While the experience of communicating with people I do not know helped build character, cold calling people everyday trying to sell over the phone is not a career path I intend to pursue. The management put a lot of emphasis on a metric system which aids in getting you going and a framework of what the day should look like.  They make you feel like you are powerful and can persuade anyone, which is necessary in the role. I worked as a College Financial Planner or \"intern\" for Northwestern Mutual, but this was nothing like your typical internship. Northwestern Mutual allows their College Financial Planners to go out and advise families and individuals just like most financial advisers. However, they are still required to become certified to sell the products they work with and are advised closely by experienced advisers. I learned more from working at Northwestern Mutual than anywhere else and it truly pushed me to become a better person and professional. Great people to work with and a supportive environment to work in. Good place to start off, hard place to work if you have a household you need to support. Lots of meetings, reporting daily. Must be a self motivated to continue in this business. Enjoyed the internship program, however at a young age it was hard to onboard clients who do not necessarily need the services. Great motivators and team culture. i worked as an intern here and really enjoyed the idea of finance until i met the mentor he ruined the experience for me and several others. It was okay until that time you cold call you freinds and family. If you are interested in sales it is a great job but would recommed for summer after sophmore year not junior year as it doesnt help get jobs after graduaation Its a very upscale environment. All workers generally are great to get along with and helpful. There is a constant need for engagement in work activities. The incentive packages leave as little to be desired however. Incredible opportunity to build your own financial planning practice. Most rewarding and inspirational Internship program available for college students. Valuable life lessons. Learn more about yourself every day. Running your own business in a sense with their support. A lot of traveling, be used to hearing no. Need to work with your own network. Be confident and know you are assisting people. This is a great career if you can make it work, but from what I saw, less than 10% of people can actually make it a career. You need to know a lot of people, and have consistent ways of meeting new people established before you start to have the best chance of being successful long-term. Not inclusive, doesn\\'t promote from within. Lots of favoritism. The company was once a wonderful place to work. Now NM is no longer warm and friendly. Northwestern Mutual is on of the most reputable insurance companies in the nation.,I was proud to be associated with Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. I worked in a support position. The managers and other co-workers were great and very helpful. I had a great time and enjoyed working there very much. Family like workplace, a typical date at work consist of administrative and client meetings. You make your own schedule. Management is very supportive The company was sales based, which is not what I was looking for. I am looking to be involved with equity, debt, and mutual fund research. The employees were nice, however. Very difficult to develop a market in this industry. You are in a sales role also so don\\'t let a recruiter convince you different. You are expected to make 40 calls a day and you have to find those people to call, the company doesn\\'t do it for you. Starting off, you will be selling only life insurance, disability insurance, and long-term care.  As you pass your SIE, Series 6, and Series 63, you will start to sell all different kinds of securities. You job duties will not change though throughout the years. You will still have to call a lot of people and keep finding more people. If you\\'re going to work in the financial industry, this is the best company in the world. However, it is a difficult career and not for everyone. You will take a personality test upon hiring to see if your personality matches with those who are successful in the business. This does not determine your hiring, but will give both you and NM a good idea of what you\\'ll do. The job is 100% commission based with no base salary. As you get more into the career you will have renewals and advisory cases which will be more passive income but not nearly enough to survive on without new commissions. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Driven by good values and filled with the best of the best financial representatives! The leadership did an excellent job at modeling good practices and developing future leaders. A typical day started off with a cofrence meeting where senior employees would share experience and motivate. I learned the ins and out of the finalce world wwith both defensive and offensive ways of accumilating weath and mitigating taxes. Also interns were assigned a mentor who help coaching meeting once per week. Not a bad place to work. This was something i did however many years ago so it is not the most relevant to my job history but people looking at getting into the financial industry this is a solid choice. This is a company that is growing and going through a lot of change. Great place to work if you are on the right team. I would recommend this company. In my area, day-to-day work was overall a pleasant experience. The vast majority of employees are friendly. Lunches are healthy and help my work/life balance in that I didn\\'t have to prepare my own lunch. You must ask,1- Are you at the point of starting your career?,2- Are you in the middle of leaving your career?,3- Do you truly have a market to develop your career?,Do it for 6 months, base results on HARD numbers, not on \"potential\" to get more. This is a hard job. Do not kit yourself thinking all it takes is title and good looks. ,Must balance: ,1- Owning own business. ,2- Finding potential clients. ,3- Having over 5,000 numbers of people to call to have at least 3 years to take off a career. ,4- There is a lot of majoring in minors. ,5- You must take full ownership of your own situation, good or bad. ,6 - IT NEVER STOPS. ,7- You might make things complicated by wanting to learn more, but you are only to sell. ,8- Getting an education or developing your knowledge, skill, career only comes by you going after the series 7 and 66, balance every plan with investments and study for your CFP from day one. ,9 - You are getting a masters doing the job. ,10- You got a way to pay for the masters, either joint work or study hard every day. ,11- If you have a family, it is possible, but you better have an amazing market to go to. ,12 - Be smart, do your due diligence. Do not take this lightly. A typical work day may include one or two meetings.  It included meeting new and potential future financial reps almost daily.  Working with them to get them off to a great start in their new career.  Sales data was compiled daily, weekly and monthly and reported to Southern California offices.  Calendar management, researching for presentations and developing presentations was an integral part of the job as well. NWM is a classy organization. Commission based, you get what you put into it.. The problem is finding out what agents need to do. Being an agent is like running your own business: there are no work hours, just hours to work. At the beginning, agents are living and breathing the company sales process until they hit their stride. For some, this may take a few years depending how they apply the leads process and control Seminars. The knowledge aspect of Company training is normally implemented in degrees and some agents graduate faster than others. The marketing and selling is dependent on the person. Management, I have noticed, with my time spent at New York Life is hit or miss depending on the manager (as with most places) and the fit. Usually turnover is very HIGH,  we should expect to see maybe 3 or 4 people stick with it in a training class of about 30 or so. This career is tough for the every day person, but if the right skill set is applied, agents find satisfaction and reward. If you\\'re a financial rep, you work endlessly and pray for commission. If you\\'re staff, you get pushed out so the owner can hire in another one of his relatives. The people are nice, and they pay pretty well, but there\\'s no job security. It\\'s a pretty formal office, with a pretty strict dress code. There\\'s no schedule flexibility. Benefits are pretty good. Free parking pass downtown any time, any day. Working at Northwestern Mutual was bad, it is a company for someone that is experienced and already has a book of business. ,REALLY hard to be successful unless you\\'re at the right environment. ,If you do not possess a \"start my own\" business mindset, you will NOT be successful. There is NO salary, ONLY commission based and bonus on performance. ,Training is 3 weeks. UNPAID. You have to cover all costs to get to and from the office if you\\'re commuting by mass transit. THEY WILL NOT PAY ANYTHING TO YOU OTHER THAN YOUR BUSINESS THAT YOU BRING IN!!!!,They will make you build a list of 200 names composed of friends, family, ex-coworkers and etc when you come in to train for them. Then they will teach you about their products and services as well as language. Then they will have you dial everyday to set up appointments in what they call \"prospecting day weekend\" where you will try to tell your friends and family what you do and then they will push you to sell them Life insurance and insurance products.,After you graduate from their training program they expect you to have minimum of 25 appointments PER week. Anything less you will be in danger of being let go. ,This is a opportunity for someone that has a large warm circle and is able to cold call (2-400 dials a day) to build a practice. ,This company wants you to sell LIFE INSURANCE!! It is NOT a financial services company. They tell you they are but they are only an insurance company and offer the most basic mutual funds. Nothing more.,So if you like to be an insurance salesman then this is perfect for you,, if not then stay away!,I was in the Farmingdale location. The people were cold, there was not any \"real\" help. The person dedicated to help me with the submitting of paperwork for policies to the home office, told me to do it on my own and had a nasty attitude at times. VERY unprofessional lady. ,When you start off, the Sr. Advisor will take HALF of your commission because they\"helped\" you sell. There is nothing you can do unless you do a case completely on your own and ON TOP of them taking half your money, your client they helped you with will ALSO become their client so any future sale you do, they will take half no matter what in the future: PYRAMID SCHEME.,Most of the time, your older advisors are REALLY busy with their own clients that it becomes difficult for you to start bc they cant come to your meetings. Several times i felt disrespected that advisors would cancel on a meeting with a client of ours because they \"didn\\'t feel\" like it would be a good case and you end up looking terrible to your client. ,They do not care about you and your business, they will help you once it is a big case so you better be able to attract whales as they say.,Lastly, after your first year they will make you pay monthly rent for your office, supplies, computer, marketing material, business cards ,software and anything you use that is theirs. To me that was a HUGE red flag.,You will be meeting with your managing director once a week on Monday and it will be a meeting basically to see how many calls you make and how much business you do. My meetings were terrible and at some point useless. It was all the same, no opportunity to learn and grow.,You are also expected to have 60 meetings minimum a month, or what they call 25 ahead, so every week you need 25 meetings. If you fail, you will be pushed out. They will not care too much for you other than tell you what you need to do to sell insurance. ,Lastly, NO MATTER what your client may need, the Sr Advisor WILL push Life insurance down the clients throat. Beware the people you work with because they will make or break your business.,In essence, i do not agree with the way NWM does business and runs its shop. A lot needs to change. I will recommend you stay away from this place. There are many better companies to work for out there. If you are comfortable with someone taking half your money in the beginning , feeling like a nuisance to senior advisors, having to share all of your early clients forever, like to cold call at least 200 times a day, having to push people to buy life insurance when they don\\'t need it and being a SALESMAN and paying for supplies, marketing material, rent on your office, laptop and etc as well as paying your own when attending conferences of the company then go ahead and work there. ,THAT is the reality of working at NWM. Don\\'t be deceived at the job interviews. They will not tell you half of this stuff until you realize how bad the business structure is 1 month in. Very nice place to work if management wasn\\'t so bad. I wouldn\\'t recommend the call center. Great place if you were working in a different department.. This first step to gaining a potential client is meeting with them in their home or over lunch. It is important to build rapport and make them feel cimfortable. The more relaxed they are, the easier it is to discuss business and see how the collaboration best fits. I enjoyed these meetings and like to think that clients and people I met with felt comfortable around myself. Excellent building and campus. Nice work place. Management is Great and always encouraging. Appreciate every good work. Supportive and collaborative environment. Nice to maintain workload and balance. Business partners are very understanding and understanding. Lots of technologies to learn and explore. It is so far from what they describe during the interview process. I believe the problem is with this office itself. The other office within the network are good but Memphis just gives off bad vibes and has some of the worst management and culture I\\'ve ever been apart of. Do yourself a favor and consider elsewhere This is a great company to work for if you are looking to pursue a career in the insurance and financial services industries.  The staff is helpful and there to assist you with whatever is needed. its a great environment to cut your teeth. you will face a lot of rejection and be forced to face a lot of your inner demons. if you can stick it out for the first 5-7 years you will be glad you did. being a career changer with a growing family makes the job difficult. you have to earn your work life balance and it takes years to get there. Typical day consist of a few meetings and then phoning to set meetings to meet with clients to help them become financially secure. Here at NWM I learned the in\\'s and out\\'s about the insurance world and the different opportunities there are working for the company. The hardest part about the company in this industry is that it is commission based. Culture is strong and difficult to gain credibility within your own department based on the years of service you have had with the company. Great benefits, which is what attracted me to the company, but salary ranges seem to be low. Management style is not consistent across the company. Some managers are better than others. The company is very meeting-heavy. You could spend most of your day in meetings, while clients are angry with your unavailability. Walking from building to building downtown is a big time-waster and company has difficulty embracing technology. There is a lack of trust among remote workers or anyone who can\\'t be seen in the office on a regular basis. It\\'s the first large company I\\'ve worked for where a majority (if not all) are Christians, which is refreshing! , ,The most rewarding part of my job is helping people. They appreciate the top notch personal customer service we provide. Overall great place, but can depend on your manager. ,Culture is shifting from long-term employment and focused more on technical qualifications rather than industry. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Northwestern Mutual is a company that is highly based in Life Insurance. It really pushes the issue when it comes to selling life and disability insurance. I 100% agree with the business model but the way they go about doing it is interesting. They drive the \"under 5\" reps to do 40 dials a day and to do as much joint work \"teaming up with other reps\" as possible. This is only due to the fact that there is a high turnover rate and Northwestern Mutual does not want to have High net worth clients to be orphans. ,I take my time here and am very productive. I do believe that it lacks diversity in leadership and consistency in the way leaders are selected. It is a 100% commission job with no base salary. They do provide a small weekly stipend for new hires while they are going through training. In the beginning, it appeared to be a great place to work, based on the motivational speeches, stories of personal impact, and huge earnings potential. As a new financial representative you need to come in with a ton of contacts and money in the bank. You could go weeks and months without any income. You spend most of your day calling or having meeting with \"prospects\". There are a lot of daily/weekly/monthly training meetings with groups and leaders. At times there are almost too many meetings. In the beginning you are basically hounding your family, friends, and acquaintances to purchase life, disability, and long term care insurance from you. You also end up hounding those same people to provide you with more contacts to hound. You have certain productivity goals each day/week/month that revolve around phone calls and meetings. If you call enough people and set enough meetings you \"should\" get the expected number of new clients and lives. There is a minimum new client and lives goal that must be met by the 6 month mark. If you don\\'t meet that minimum you are encouraged to move on.  While you trying to get your business off the ground and generate income in your first 6 months, sometimes spending nights and weekends working, you are expected to study for/take multiple state insurance license tests and the 6/63 security license exams. The company does pay for you to get your first two states insurance licences as well as your 6/63.You, are required to have \"joint work\" prospect/client meetings with seasoned veterans and split the commission earned if the prospect/client decides to move forward with anything. Without your 6/63 license you can\\'t even talk financial planning and so your \"joint work partner\" takes the lead in all conversations. You also don\\'t earn commission on financials until you have your 6/63 license. The management team was great most of the time, offering many learning opportunities, but if you are not cutting it, they can be harsh and ultimately move on from you. It appears that only 1/100 new financial representatives make it past 6 months. They are always recruiting for and trying to fill open positions. Some people make it a week or two, others a month or two, some make 3-6 months, but very few make it past 6 months. The \"college intern program\" is where most of the successful financial representatives come from. They get catered too and are set up for success. There seems to be a lot more time and energy spent on them than those that are career changers. The position allows you virtually unlimited flexibility and income potential, but it is 100% commission based, thus high activity and a drive to sell insurance products in your first year should be expected. ,The training received is very good, but make sure that - once you begin working in the field - you choose good joint work partners that are willing to assist you throughout the sales cycle so that prospects and clients do not fall off. ,It is crucial that you have somewhat of a nest-egg before you begin this career, as it is 100% commission based. One may receive a generous sign-on bonus, but for most established professionals, the bonus will virtually only cover virtually 1-2 months of expenses, both personal and business related. ,Overall, the representative position is perfect for one that thrives in a competitive environment where a client first, sales second mentality must be adopted. The company has a very low tolerance for professionals that do not follow procedures and take advantage of prospects and clients to make a quick buck. Boiling it down, the client must come first in order for one to be successful in with this company. I started at Northwestern Mutual as an intern and then became a full-time financial representative, they really help you in preparing for required certifications. If you don’t know at least 300 people, don’t have family with millions to invest or if your looking for support, stay away.,You work for chop shop District Offices, not NM. You don’t get paid what you earn, you pay to work.,If your a narcissistic person who talks the talk about the client comes first, go for it. You’ll learn quickly about who you are. Stay true to yourself, trust your gut, and in it for clients, you make a salary after 10 years of very hard work.,If you don’t have $100,000 saved to start your own “Financial Planning Business” don’t bother. You will sell insurance for a year to your friends and family, while the GA you work for holds your commission in a “general account” they use to pay higher ranking agents, office utility bills, etc.,I would encourage you to use them to get sponsored for your needed securities licences in desired financial field. Study hard, get desired license quickly, and get out. Just need to sell some insurance on the side while you study.,You have been warned. It can be a great place to work because of everyone that works in the office. Although, if there\\'s the off chance that you are working for a not so great Rep, it will definitely not work out for your career. Great company culture. Hard to get foot in the door. Great support by other employees. Semi annual business trips. Great internship training. Hard work in the beginning. Great culture and great place to work at especially if you are disciplined enough to build your own practice. It is a heavy sales job and starts off with mostly selling insurance. The job will enhance a lot of skills and form many others. Employees are constantly bombarded with pressure to refer new clients and prospective financial representatives to the company, which is annoying. Other than that, it can be very lucrative and decent. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Northwestern, and have only great things to say about the company. It was just not a good fit for me. To all prospective employees, I would encourage you to make sure if you enter the field, you already have a strong natural market and work near where you have strong roots. Typical Day consist of whatever we decide to do in order to sell at least 20 lives in 6 months. I learned a lot about being an efficient financial adviser. The hardest part of the job was being okay with people saying know and actually getting quality referrals. good career, only if you have a solid financial foundation of your own, as compensation is commission-based only. Cold-calling is strongly encouraged. Products include insurance, investments, and retirement. I enjoyed working for northwestern mutual.  I worked as a campus recruiter and contracting licensing and registration coordinator.   It was a great environment, the leadership staff really challenged you to grow and you had autonomy in the role. , However, there is a lot of pressure to meet high demands which can cause strains on your personal life outside of work.Some expectations were unrealistic and weren’t worth the ultimate headache Working at NML helped me develop sales skills,  and understanding the art of financial planning.  The company was very supportive and driven to develop new advisers for success.   Compensation is driven strictly on production alone,  no base salary. I love my work although my manager is building his business and that leaves me working less than part-time.  Northwestern Mutual is an outstanding company with traditional values, catering to older clients, (visiting their homes for policy updates, etc..  I value my role but I am accustomed to working 40+ hours with benefits.  Independent agents work at the many locations and eventually build a great clientele.  I have been honored to be part of such a great company. If you are a young professional starting your career and open to entering an unprofessional work environment, then Northwestern Mutual is the place for you. The lack of culture and unprofessional leadership will make you dread going to work every morning. No room for growth. No tools and resources. Everything is about your daily activity. Everyone talks behind other employees backs. Additionally,  there is absolutely no structure within the organization. You have absolutely no idea who you are suppose to report to. Their compensation and benefits are terrible.  They do not care about their employees. Your purpose at Northwestern Mutual is to make the Managing Partner and Director more money. A typical day is driven by your desire to make your practice successful.,You find how strong your drive toward making you practice profitable.,The companies management was strong and desires that their producers to succeed. However, some offices were more helpful to their producers.,The hardest part of the job was all the cold calling that\\'s need to get a meeting. About 3000 calls may get 20 meetings and maybe one new client.,Getting a new client and knowing that you will have the opportunity to build a relationship with that person\\'s financial advisor. I enjoy working at Northwestern Mutual. The company culture is great. The hardest part of the job is bringing in new clients because they are based off of referrals. If you don\\'t have a large network of people do not pursue this job. In a recent survey NM performed poorly on the OHI index due to mass layoffs and employee dissatisfaction with their management. Employees do not understand how they fit in the company strategy and management does little to address that concern. Also, NML leaders seem to put those managers in place that know the work but have little to no people skills. This contributes to high rates of turnover and low morale among employees who stayed behind. Don\\'t start a career unprepared with connects looking for insurance- it\\'s an uphill battle that starts everyday even before you begin employment at Northwestern Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Although the internship wasn\\'t for me I have to warn others. It is competitive. You need to have a strong will to win. Can be stressful but you make the most of it. If you\\'re a hard worker that does not shy away from potentially failing, you will do very well here. The trainings are very efficient and in depth. The mentorship programs help to keep you motivated and there is a high level of autonomy. Intern at Northwestern Mutual. The internship experience was awesome. They love to help and the work if much need life experience. Learned how to manage time, connect with others, get over fears, and very challenging job. I learned how to be independent, manage individuals and research. This company fostered individual and professional growth. The management is supportive and encouraging. It is a great work environment. ,You have to be willing to take a major gamble on yourself, and it\\'s not an easy career. But if you work hard the opportunity for great success is there if you are able to master it. The work allows creative freedom and group collaboration.    The culture is very meeting heavy so time management skills are a strong must have.   Benefits are good. The have free lunch.,time in between support calls was very laxxed in terms of if you had to go to bathroom or make a phone. Unless there was \"all hands on deck\" But there are many slow times so you get to relax a bit check up on your email, help other people in our it group chat. There was nothing really hard about the job except for the delays in requests to get to try and shadow similar divisions. It will push you down everyday wondering when that day would come, even with continual conversation. ,The Best think of this job are the people, no bad apples. everybody is curious, makes jokes, helps each other out. Some are of my great friends. Excellent opportunities to grow in all departments. ,Good team work and productive work place.,Brilliant culture with an emphasis on working today to achieve more. Work life is pretty collaborative and smooth. Not stressful and the work environment is super friendly. Learned a lot. Would definitely recommend someone to work here. It was the push I needed, but did not suite me, it was a commission based job, but I learned a whole lot! The staff was very helpful and supported all of my decisions Calling for financial planning for individuals. Hard work is key to being successful. I enjoy controlling my own practice and striving to be better every day. This is a better program for people who can afford to go without much or any money for 6 months, and then rely on relatively small income for a couple of years while they build up their book.  Not good for parents or people who have an established lifestyle. - Ability to make own schedule,- I learned a lot about financial planning and about myself,- GREAT leadership,- Beautiful office and culture,- The hardest part about the job is that it is commission based pay only,- The most enjoyably part of the job were the people I worked with and getting to meet new people everyday. A typical workday consists of phoning and meeting with clients. Very flexible hours. Joint work is advised and helps getting stuff done. Overall great company culture. Always people around you willing to motivate you to achieve your goals. Also, many of the peers are highly qualified successful individuals looking to make a difference. Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work with good opportunities, but it very much depends on the agency in which you are employed or contracted to. Being an Intern for only a summer I feel as if there was so much pressure to sell the products. That being said I feel as if the training was more on how to sell rather than what we were selling. THe management was amazing and they were involved in the entire company as awhole, not just those in upper management. As an intern I felt known by him. I learned a ton about how to run a business from start to start! This position has helped me grow into the young executive I am today.You will learn so much valuable things and help others in the process. Distinctive association between contractor and employee. Not benefits from the association of employee to the benefits of a contractor. High security profile. Parking lot and free food at the cafeteria. A typical day would be meeting with 3-5 potential clients and dialing the phone between 30-40 times. If you do not meet these numbers regularly, you will be evaluated. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. If you have a rock star network and prospect list.  Great place to work.,If you land a post at the home office - this does not apply - - Home Office, is a great place to work! At Northwestern Mutual, they equip you with all the necessary tools you need to succeed. I was able to work alongside experienced Financial Advisors greatly boosting my skills and knowledge within the Financial Services Industry. Overall, awesome company with loads of resources. Solid job. Make own schedule, and a good training program. Must be able to ask friends and family to give you their money. Only commission. Overall, solid job. There is so much to learn in the space of personal finance, with Northwestern Mutual they gave me a format to digest investment vehicles, budgeting, fund prioritizing, fund allocation, tax efficiency,  and that\\'s only the surface. The bulk of the job included getting the largest number of contacts, referrals, and meetings. Which were my most and least enjoyable parts of the job.,The best was meeting with someone who had little experience in finance and through our conversation and some planning could get all their concerns put to rest and be excited looking forward.,The distasteful part that inevitably led to my leaving was the large amount of calling strangers and large focus on insurance sales numbers. Fun but tough place to work. \"Live to work\" at this place rather than \"work to live\" mentality until you have made it. If you\\'re not a high producer than you\\'re not a favorite. Don\\'t come here if you want a meaningful internship. Horrible experience, didn\\'t get paid for the first three months I was there. Finally received my stipend after being at NM for 12 weeks and received it steadily for a few months. Management then ghosted my text messages and I didn\\'t receive pay for another two weeks and left. ,Management doesn\\'t care about their interns and uses them to increase their leads. Hard work and within the first few years very high turnover rate. You rely on calling known people first then through meeting and selling insurance, you ask for references to continue to grow your business. You really get to see what it is like to be a financial planner. You definitely need to try it out to see if the job is for you. It definitely takes a certain type of person to work at the job. The employees are very welcoming and eager to help new members of the team. It also is considered to be an independent job so you will have to do things alone. However, people are willing to help you if you get stuck. Northwestern was a fabulous entry level recruiting opportunity. It helped me grow and develop my skills as a recruiter. the culture was very positive. A career as a financial representative with Northwestern Mutual is  very challenging. As the owner of your financial practice, you are very much a business owner. In that, you need to live and breathe your business in order to \"make it.\" That means the first three years of the career you are over worked and under paid as you build your book of business. While the opportunity did not work out for me, it was a great 18 months and I would not trade back my time for the incredible experience and education I learned. Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work at if you appreciate strong management and well-structured days. The culture is heavily focused on the companies mission statement and providing the best service for NM\\'s clients. Also, the new corporate office is absolutely amazing. The company itself - Northwestern Mutual is fine. The financial advisor I had worked for was very unpleasant to deal with and did not make me feel like I wanted to continue working for him in particular. Good work environment. Resources are always available for you to progress in the company. Mostly commission based, with a small amount of stiped. Would recommend to a person who excels at sales. This is a great place to work for self-motivated hard workers. Earning potential is uncapped, schedules are flexible because you set your own client meetings, and mentorship is built into the workday model. Everyone in management does everything they can to help you succeed. I interviewed for a position as an intern and it turns out that the internship is just trying to get college students to see insurance to their friends and family members while receiving a small cut of the sales. Pyramid scheme. I expected better, but students, don\\'t waste your time. Best product out there for life insurance!  If I could do it again, I would try to sell only 65 life instead of 90 life to a younger crowd and maybe have been more serious about getting my 6, 63, & 7 series tests passed sooner to offer more products.  I would NOT have done it at the young age I was for a career not knowing many people that made much money (came from a retail environment before).  Straight commission makes it hard, but I still have my policies 19 years later and only 24 more left to pay on my 65L.  Happy with the cash value building up, but make sure you don\\'t overinsure in case of job loss, etc.  Management was great.  Setting your own schedule was great.  Hardest thing is to make sales for people that don\\'t want to talk about something they don\\'t think they need until it is too late. At NM the typical day would start with a meeting around 7:30am. Then you prepare for the day and start making calls at 9am. Typically it was expected that you would have 5 meetings scheduled for each day. Overall it was very flexible and you created your own schedule with the exception of scheduled company meetings. The culture was great, it was a competitive workplace yet it was also a place where everyone learned from each other. It is a nice peaceful working environment  . If someone wants to retire after working at one company then this the place. Benefits are good and they have an awesome free lunch. This was a very hard internship to get into, however, the hard work does payoff. If you are self-motivated and want to succeed, nobody is stopping you. If you want to make more money, you do it at your own will. The hardest part of this job is pushing your comfort zone and if you find yourself comfortable in the job you may need to be working harder. I found that I was not suited for insurance sales and lost interest in this line of work. I worked for Northwestern Mutual as an intern when I was 20 years old. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Like running your own business.,Constant hustle with a good purpose.,Have to have tough skin.,NEtworking with great people and teaching them financial literacy while preparing clients unique plan is great skill. ,Financial empowerment gained from working at Northwestern Mutual.,Not a fan of cold calling however if youre good at networking consider it more of a warm call. - A typical day consisted of managing a case load of 100-150 clients,- The biggest thing someone can learn from this job is how to properly manage a client database ,- The management is very helpful for all employees involved in the company ,- It is a very family like culture that also likes to take part in friendly competitions,- The hardest part of the job is learning that sometimes the smallest details actually do make a big difference. So attention to detail is key. ,- What makes this job most enjoyable is learning new things and meeting new people on a daily basis It is a great place to work and I love the people here! I have my own work space even as an Intern and I was always treated with respect. The culture at Northwestern Mutual is always been so amazing. Northwestern Mutual\\'s job culture has to be the most amazing thing about the company. Highly intelligent, goal-oriented individuals that work hard and play even harder! You will get exactly what you put into the internship. It is very challenging. You are provided opportunities for mentorship, but you have to follow up and use your resources. No one will do the job for you. This is not a simple desk job, it is fully sales and individually driven. This internship is not for everyone, but those who work at it will succeed. Many people will join the internship and most will drop out. attend meetings, work on ICRM reports and upload documents on sharepoint, worked as part of team , Job was not hard it was something that i enjoyed doing. This industry is exactly what you\\'d think, insurance, financials and planning. It\\'s lucrative, competitive, difficult, exhilarating and thought provoking. Not for the faint of heart or for lazy people. Loved my time here and would recommend to anyone that wants a career in growth, development and sales. Most people fire themselves before a \"manager\" does. If you don\\'t know how to grind and give up some of your life for success then this is not for you.,Be comfortable being uncomfortable! The hardest part of the job was prospecting with family and friends and finding time to study for all the tests. Series 6, 65 &7. Hard tests that need ample time to study but if you take time to study you can get behind on prospecting and appointments. It\\'s a numbers game. The more people you meet with the higher the chances are of making a client. The first few years most typically are very lean. Be prepared to live on a tight budget. Or better yet, have a large cushion built up to fall back on until you\\'re up and running. ,Once your get established your need to hire employees to keep up with the pace. But if you can hanging in there and work hard with no letting up... It can be VERY lucrative. Only been with the company a few months. It\\'s a tough industry, which is applicable to selling insurance and financial planning as a whole. The company itself helps its employees and works towards their success. Most crucial part of the job is building a clientele. If you can\\'t network and fill up your pipeline early you will be in trouble. Management tries to train you but your success comes completely from taking matter in your own hand. Typical day involves making phone calls and scheduling meetings. Will deal with a lot of rejection, tough to make it past the early years but if you are able to you will reap the benefits of this career. The people and environment were incredible. I was challenged while encouraged. I grew in many areas. Although I knew I didn\\'t want to go into business, working here made me reconsider. Overall this company just wants you to recruit more people to do financial planning. A lot of cold calling and referrals. If you’re not into sales or uncomfortable with it this is not for you. If you are looking to sell insurance, this is a great place to be.  If you are looking to manage wealth, look elsewhere.  Good people, but it is definitely a sales job The overall culture is very positive and the work day is dependent on your role. The movement toward a digital transformation and an agile mindset has created a plethora of opportunities to show off your technical chops. The management is quick paced and brings a demanding result driven atmosphere. ,The enjoyment was working innovation and seeing experimentation build products that brought back tremendous value to the organization and allowed anyone within the company to participate in this movement. Being a commission only job, everyone was very independent and concentrated on what they were doing.  The atmosphere was friendly but quiet.  The most enjoyable part of the job was travelling and meeting with potential clients. The overall experience lacked structure and training. It also felt like the main goal was to use interns to have them contact wealthy family/friends in order to meet with them and hopefully win them over as clients, without actually teaching the interns all that much. Free lunch, up-to-date equipment/computers, excellent managers!  Nice co-workers to work with that are respectful and helpful.  It\\'s always a team effort. - 30 minutes team minutes,- Check calendar.,- Start prioritizing tasks.,- Respond emails.,- Help other team members,- Flexible lunch break (30-45min),- Working day hours: 8 hours typically Great company to work for, very established in the finance industry, lots of opportunity to succeed and amazing culture. Northwestern pushes each employee to be successful and even if their role isn\\'t quite the right fit, they will find one that is. Nashville office really pursues comprehensive planning. Start with insurance then add in assets the more experienced you get and the more clients you bring on. ,Have to hit the sales numbers, ton of calling, strictly commission and have to run your own business. ,Great culture, tons of resources and people willing to help. Hold you accountable. Get to make a lasting impact on your clients. ,Ton of hard work but there is no ceiling. If you make it you make it big. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. This was a pleasant place to work. Everyone got along well. It was an independent work environment. Free parking. Good work/life balance. Each associate worked for a specific representative. But we also worked together to help each other. The Golden Rule applies and those working at NM are very conscientious of the philosophies and goes out of their way to ensure clients and fellow team members are treated incredibly well. I was briefly at northwestern mutual, but there was numerous people let go while I was there.  Culture was not up to the standard as expected.  Management did not seem engaged and most contact was with the training team who were let go. Great place to work and premier employer in the Milwaukee area. Plenty of room to grow your skill set and ample development opportunities all-around. Supportive managers and knowledgeable teams. If you’re not used to corporate politics, siloed disciplines and working with a large, risk-adverse enterprise, consider if you’re up to it before applying. Change takes time, and there’s plenty of it needed to continue to be competitive. got along with everyone in the office right away, solid competitive nature amongst everyone. Learned a lot about life and health insurance through interactive workshops during the internship. Was told in person that anyone would be given warning before being considered for being fired for any reason. It was a lie. The work was very easy, and not very demanding, but not a trustworthy area of management Overall it was a good experience. The company has a lot of resources for their new employees to utilize and they also take a lot of time to train them. You must be self motivated to succeed, it is a commission based job... A typical day was calling all the people we could and prospecting and gaining new potential leads. We would then set up times to meet with them for lunch or whatever they wanted and try to build a plan to sell. The company provides exceptionally training and advancement opportunities. Experienced employees are generally very helpful and want to see new employees succeed. Would give it a pass as here to apply for new jobs instead of providing feedback for current client employer. May come back later when it\\'s time to move on. As an Intern at Northwestern Mutual I learned a lot with real work experience. Northwestern Mutual provided plenty of training to help me become a successful Financial Adviser. At the beginning of my internship I did a lot of calling and setting up meetings, but as the internship progressed I went through several different real job experiences to help me get the feel of what being a Financial Adviser is really like. Overall it was a great experience and I enjoyed it. they are there to bring in new people for the contacts only. they will use you down to your last dollar and then send you a bill. They don\\'t tell you about LAG times for being paid. Also they try to get you to recruit your friends. especially if they are a minority or women because they have a problem in that culture of all white men. Sketchy, sketchy, sketchy!!! The culture is amazing, and everyone is very helpful, in your first couple of months. After that, you have to hustle and be very independent. If you are young and do this job, there is a 99% chance you will not make it. It is strictly commision unless you become an underwriter, so it is not a stable job either. The college adviser position  at Northwestern Mutual was interesting opportunity. The management was extremely willing to train and wanted each of their employees to be successful. However, the way you make money is having a large network and selling insurance to people in that network. A lot of cold calling. It wasn\\'t what I had expected. I loved the thought that I would have freedom of creating my own business, however, it was required to share meetings with \"experience\" reps. This was not always easy trying to schedule someone that was available when the potential client was. Great place to work. Wish there was a full time position available.         ,Learned a lot from employer,Everyone is very friendly. ,I was a contractor. There was no formal, structured on-boarding plan for new skill sets required.  Unless you have the EXACT skills/tools needed for your job you will be set up for failure. Hard place to work but worth the benefits. Managing director is great and everyone is generally very nice and hard working. Easy to control your own salary. Northwestern Mutual is a great company with great people. They will train you from day one and you have a support network of people to support you every step of the way. They encourage and celebrate hard work and will reward you for it as well. The work is challenging and not for everyone, you have to be very determined. lots of work, commission only, lots of prospecting, need to sell whole life to be successful, must be a self starter and have a solid network of friends/prospects Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. This position will have to in a constant dilemma as you wrestle with the fact that you are leveraging every personal relationship you have ever had for financial gain. Do not work for this company! You work for spin off companies representing NM. They do not pay fair commission, charge for every expense, force you to do joint work and split commission with warm market.,Horrible people Northwestern Mutual had built an enormous amount of trust and brand loyalty in their client base over the 150+ years in existence. Also, it had a solid corporate culture where employees felt valued and supported. Though, it had an antiquated infrastructure, systems, processes and staff. In the past decade, the company has transformed with the intention of properly aligning the business with the changing financial industry. This includes increased digital accessibility of information and a more wholistic offering of financial security beyond the flagship life insurance products. Conceptually, this transformation sounded like something I wanted and did choose to rally behind. Though, it quickly became apparent that the list of cons outweighed the pros. There was a significant loss in strong leadership which had enterprise-wide impacts including lack of strategic vision, significant loss in company-wide, departmental and team communication and collaboration. There was an overwhelming and continued failure in properly and respectfully managing team and organizational restructuring (staffing loss/gain) resulting in an immense amount of employee fear, distrust and overall inefficiency. Looking back, I recall how the company felt slow moving due to said outdated items. Though, now the company feels slow moving due to an overwhelming amount of chaos, lack of leadership strength and collaboration. It\\'s understandable that achieving massive change at a large corporation would involve some chaos and/or mess, but I feel that while the company pursues their transformation they have negatively, impacted the brand loyalty and trust of their client base to perhaps a detrimental degree. 工作环境优异，每个人工作热情很高，活动范围光，时间活跃，凭能力领取工资，员工间竞争氛围强。对新实习生工作安排妥当。 hit the ground running if you are willing to work hard. starting with training they brought in great reps to build your confidence from. this business is not for everyone however. I was merely an intern at Northwestern Mutual. I learned a lot and took away important leadership skills. I eventually left the internship because the career was just not for me. Fun perks such as free lunch and onsite clinic to name a few.  During my time, had some bad managers that drove people away instead of supporting a collaborative environment.  Company talked about innovation and moving in a new direction however there was a major disconnect from leadership and business operation employees.  Besides this, there are people who genuinely care and are there for you if you reach out. Must be driven and ready to work but the culture is great. The mentorship program and helpful nature of the employees makes the work life very enjoyable. I worked with Northwestern Mutual as a college intern. It was very fun, provided a significant challenge, and forced you out of your comfort zone. They provided comprehensive tools to help advise client\\'s financial goals. I was a contracted employee at Northwestern Mutual for about a year and a half.  Throughout my entire time, I obtained overwhelmingly positive feedback from every single one of my colleagues, as well as management.  Yet, when the time came for a Full-Time role possibility to get off of my contract, I was offered a \"Long-Term Temporary\" position instead, because there was not enough headcount for a Full-Time Position.  Long-term temporary employees must pay double for benefits and do not receive the full benefit package as the normal full-time staff receives.  This was their attempt to string me along and was extremely discouraging due to the feedback I was receiving and the quality of work I was producing.  ,I did not accept the offer.,I am sure it is great to be a full-time employee at Northwestern Mutual and my feedback would probably be very different if that was the case.  Unfortunately I never had the luxury of that option, although my performance said otherwise.  Simply put, they were happy to keep me on contract for years to save money from hiring me full-time.,Lastly, the one thing Northwestern Mutual does right is their lunch.  Free lunch for their employees is something that can easily taken for granted and is one of the nicest benefits that employees and even contractors can experience. The CUD\\'s are helpful when it comes to answering questions. The full time representatives help reassure interns that may be discouraged by the slow start to the sales cycle. I worked for NWM both in downtown Milwaukee and in Franklin Wi and the experience differentiation  based on location is unbelievable. My downtown experience was extremely work place progressive, we had no specific lunch times we went when it felt appropriate per your job and the business, there was micro management, we had frequent meetings with my manager who wanted to support the comfortability of us at work.,Franklin was the complete opposite, it felt like working for a totally different company, I was extremely caught off guard by the climate change. They really live up to their 5 values of Growth, Excellence, Courage, Fun, and Vision. ,It was a challenging but rewarding experience where you learn from some of the best in the business, but you must really push yourself and not slack. While working for Northwestern Mutual, I found that the company culture was not close knit and a bit awkward. They skimped over proper training, so I never felt as though I was going to mess up the system. Great company and great products.Excellent training and up to date technology.  Highly recommended company with moral and ethics.  Two thumbs up.  Very happy. There is a vast earning potential if you are willing to sacrifice your life outside of work for it. Lots of changes in management go on and goals are sometimes hard to establish I enjoyed my time at Northwestern mutual. When I left the culture was in the process of changing.  However, the company had many employees that had been in their positions for 15 plus years that were there to collect their check and go home.   Great place if you\\'re one of those folks. Northwestern Mutual has many great people working for them with a strong culture in addition. However the job as a financial representative can be very challenging as it\\'s 100% commission. Enjoyed working at the agency office,  administrative staff meetings allowed exchange of helpful information and knowledge to improve assisting the financial advisors. Best work place ive been in so far, competitive but satisfying. Management is top notch and lots of advancement opportunities. Also, easy access to leadership Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Be aware what it means when they say it\\'s commission only. High level of stress can be seen all over the office. Upper management cares about their bottom line and how you are making them money. You can meet some very good people in this company. The company has does a lot to help you grow and they are a very good employer the culture the is one of helping others. Good productive family atmosphere coupled with a world class company.  Challenging work but fulfilling.  You are your own boss, so you have flexibility to run your business how you want. Insurance sales requires one to accept the FACT that he/she is as valuable as his/her last sale...constant pressure to produce more and a restrictive environment in terms of specific products to sell. Overall, Northwestern Mutual is an extremely established company in which an employee can rest assured will never go out of business. On top of that security, each employee is given a fair chance to prove themselves and given the right tools for success. The benefits are substantial, with many leadership opportunities as well as company perks like gym access, getaways, sales coaching, and more.,The environment in each office varies, however many of them strive to maintain the company\\'s morals of putting each client first and working in a team-based workplace. Every employee supports each other and pushes their coworkers towards success.,The leadership teams are tough, however, it is a tough job that strives to only accept the best of the best, and that shows. Excellent training in consulting and negotiating skills.  Must be excellent self-starter and disciplined in daily execution of sales efforts.,Mentoring program is excellent as well as the systems and the focus on newer planning experience methodologies for existing and prospective clients.   ,Northwestern\\'s approach to comprehensive financial planning is an industry leader and proves why they are number 1 in the planning and insurance marketplace. - It is a sales based industry but everyone in the office is very supportive and most work well together in meeting individual goals! ,- You can work 24 hours a day (Pro) ,- You could work 24 hours a day (Con) Great culture and amazing opportunity. Very competitive pay structure and hard field to stay in. Great support system and management in my office in DC. No base pay but strictly a commission and renewal pay structure. If you make it to 4-5 years in this company you will really start to excel and reap the reward. great atmosphere, great people ,free parking, free lunch, friendly staff, nice office space, overall good experience with many perks with  room for development I loved this job. This was the 1st job I ever had my entire life that I was legitimately sad to leave. Couldn\\'t ask for better people, environment and culture. Very Difficult to gain new business. Mostly cold calling current/old friends and your family members in order to get them to buy life insurance. Learned a lot about sales but not so much about financial advising/real finance. Northwestern Mutual is a great company.  Typically work 8 hours with an unpaid hour lunch,  Monday through Friday. You get every weekend and holiday off!  Office culture is great, everyone is friendly. For some reason the name resonates with a lot of folks.,the top 1% do make good money, however, they use interns to get life insurance policies from their families then leave them to dry. Too much focus on time wasting non important meeting with redundant information. If it was not for the empohasis on so many huddles and meetings NWM would have been my perfect job. Enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual, just wasn\\'t sure if it was for me. I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to insurance so it made it tough to sell to people close to me. Excellent place to work.  Very professional co-workers and atmospher.  Management very helpful.  Loved working here.  Unfortunately position was temporary.  I would recommend anyone working here. I think this survey is only directed for FR\\'s. As an associate, I do not feel as if NW cares about you or your quality of life. They have not been supportive in anyway. It is high levels of stress with little reward. Taught me a lot about the sales process and time management. After getting the Life and Health producer licenses and a week of education about the position, they send you out to the wolves with a sales quota so it\\'s up to you how well you perform and succeed.,They rely on you to build a book of business from friends and family. Amway with an insurance license. Hard job but if you are in the right market this can be a lucrative career. Good people, management depends on this office. Make sure you have enough money saved to begin career. This job is not for everyone, you have to be willing to call on your family and friends to try and sell them insurance.  As an intern the full time reps jump on your leads so be prepared for that. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. I enjoyed the people and the job. However, holding a 100% commission job right out of college was not in my deck of cards at the time. If someone is in the right place financially I would recommend. Excellent company, great benefits, work life balance, fun people. If you\\'re a self-starter and can hold yourself accountable then this company would be great for you. Fun filling family based company where you get job satisfaction and it shapes and helps to achieve career goals. A typical day starts with meeting for me where offshore hands us the job before their shifts over. They highlight us with details of their day. We resume where they left. Every team have their own goals and objectives of the day. we all meet during the lunch time, Free lunch sometimes multi cuisine. it\\'s like family get together where we talk about our jobs sometimes about family. Hardest part- So far I haven\\'t felt anything like that. Jobs are equally distributed. Each and everyone respect and at the same time value your contribution to the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is where manager send you kudos messages when critical job done or the major changes done. Working for the company where equality exercised and celebrates your cultural festivities with you it\\'s something special. Management did not have experience with the work yet tried to tell us that we were inefficient and prone to errors. Attempted to create a service that was potentially profitable so would hire less skilled workers for less pay who had no understanding of the work. CL&I suggested interventions that were completely ineffective. Employment agency representatives did nothing to help their people  learn, develop or provide support. I was an intern at Northwestern Mutual and was treated as a colleague by the full time agents. We were free to explore our own opportunities and were compensated well for doing so. IT is dying here. They outsourced 1000 jobs over the past couple years, losing centuries of experience just to save on employee costs. The culture is deadly, with a you maybe next regardless of your performance. North western is a very good company to work with.  I would recommend it to others.  Currently its going to alot of change but I think change is good. Northwestern Mutual is a stable profitable and supportive organization. It provides work life balance and has a great understanding for people with families and familial obligations. I truly enjoyed my time spent working with Northwestern Mutual. It is an honorable and noble organization that always does the right thing for its clients. Not enough pay if you are FINRA licensed.  Unorganized company within the Policyowner service department.  You have to pay for parking at Franklin campus, even though it\\'s on many acres of land Taught me a lot about the sales process and time management. After getting the Life and Health producer licences and a week of education about the position, they send you out to the wolves with a sales quota so it\\'s up to you how well you perform and succeed. Loved my position and the office.  Men to women ratio was very uneven. However, everyone who was employed were wonderful to work with.  Helping develop others was a great experience. There is no way to be Financial Rep if you have no to little contacts. They did not tell us that we would have to pay twice the tax since we were considered self-employed. As a financial representative, you are given a lot of freedom with how you structure your day and are often able to work from home on certain occasions. There is no salary base pay, only commission so it is up to you to meet with clients and make sales. Management could be improved in this area in particular, but the organization is amazing in the full scope of things. Being an advisor is a tough job but if you can stick it out you will be wildly successful,Great people, great management,Must be comfortable handling rejection Great corporate benefits, great company to work for. The leadership in the corporate office is very focused and supportive. They provide the opportunity to build and create your position, but there is not much chance for advancement if you do not live in Milwaukee. They asked me to come back to work and then let me go, but told me they would give me a letter of reference because my work was very good.  They also said they would not decline unemployment.  That\\'s all I can say without crossing a line. Working here was very different from my previous jobs . we learned a lot about how to have meetings with potential clients and how to help them with financial planning. I loved my time there. What became a deal breaker was the lack of leads. You have to go find your own clients. If you have the personality for it, go for it. It\\'s a great place, with a great culture. It was a good place to work. I made a lot of friends their and continue to love the people. It is a difficult job and requires self motivation and good connections Northwestern Mutual is a progressive company to work for that is interested in providing an inclusive culture for all of their employees. All of their campuses are beautiful and well maintained. A normal work day is 8.5 hours with 30 minutes for lunch. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. i would get into the office for 8 usually, and we would have an office meeting in the morning, Then i would either be going out on appointments or on the phone trying to schedule appointments. Management was good, they would try to give you ideas to help grow your business. The problem was they wouldn\\'t actually help you get any clients. The hardest part was trying to schedule appointments because i was completely on my own. It was very stressful because i was reaching out to people i knew, or friends of friends. Never wanted to come on too strong but i would not get paid if i didn\\'t because i was one hundred percent commission. I decided i was not comfortable trying to be forceful. The best part about the job was doing the actual job when i had the opportunity to meet with potential clients. I loved going over and creating personal financial plans for each individual client. I was meeting with a lot of young people and after going over their financial plan, most times i did not think it was in their best interest to be investing at the time. Unfortunately that meant i did not get paid The company has a good training program. It allows you to run your own business but the truth is that isn\\'t until you\\'ve sold insurance and had help from senior advisors for 5 to 10 years. The company does not have a culture respecting tenured talent.  This company has been systematically moving leadership from the local corporate office of Milwaukee to New York after a poorly managed attempt to integrate an acquired company named LearnVest.  It retains a very top down hierarchy and does not provide job security to employees. 100 % commission selling life insurance is tough these days. Although you have the ability to do extensive financial planning, insurance products are their own so there is an inherent conflict because that’s what you ge to paid on. I worked as an assistant to financial planners and insurance salespeople. I would do whatever work was available, filling out paperwork, filing, doing whatever others didn\\'t have the time to do. I would recommend the company to anyone wanting to break into insurance, marketing, or IT work. Great Benefits. Great Internship. Great Company. Management is alright. Some clients are amazing. I made a lot of calls. You have to be a motivated individual. Great learning experience when initially starting as an intern. Great office environment and fantastic coaches. Made me realize that even though the company was outstanding, I do not want to sell insurance. You can go far in this role depending on your level of commitment and how well your rep does. If you put in minimal effort you will likely be replaced. Most reps are very good about sharing their success with associates when you put forth the effort. Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work at if youre a highly sales driven individual. No leads, lofty goals and a ton of freedom make it a competitive environment. The pay could be better and nothing but commissions makes it hard to make a living sometimes. Management is great also. Over the past 5 years I have been working with the firm, I have grown to understand more about how Northwestern as a platform to begin and grow your financial advisory business seems tough to beat. While NM has allowed me exclusive access to their insurance and investment advisory platform, they also are not captive to just their products and which helps me feel confident when doing financial planning. The workplace culture was very professional and every employee takes pride in what the company represents. Upper management was very helpful with assisting the interns and new employees on how to build their own book of business. If you are looking for something that is going to give you a lot of experience I would recommend a more advanced internship. This was definitely a good internship for a freshman student looking to get experience in an office/business setting. management are very nice. Very friendly and helpful people. Starting up your business can be overwhelming, you are the one finding prospects, they don\\'t give you clients.  It is a good job if you are OK with getting a salary that is fulled shared commission. This position did not allow effective training application you get it or get left behind. Training methods and time frames were non traditional. I passed each test but was told to increase speed. good company. I liked the company a lot. Free lunch and friendly employees. Lots of training available even for the consultant. Management very open to talk to everybody Being a Financial Advisor is hard, but you are compensated for your performance. The Sioux Falls Office provides me with exceptional support and training. The culture believes in having fun, but also working hard. The first few months are difficult as you build your clientele, but you are provided with support and great leadership to coach you to success. The company believes in giving back to our communities. I feel the work I do is important, meaningful, and impact. I am in my 2nd year, and am sure I will be with NM for life!! You got to choose your own hours, had a mentor, and had two weekly meetings that checked your progress and gave you an opportunity to ask questions/request joint work. Multiple hours a day spent asking others if I could help them because there was no work of my own. Far too many hours of downtime for my personality and work ethic. A typical workday at Northwestern Mutual is to meet with potential clients and discuss financial situation and goals.  Along with meeting clients it is imperative that you acquire referrals and reach out to qualified suspects to try and set new appts (5/day).  I learned a lot about the financial services industry, its products and how the general public handles their own financial situations.  Colleagues are very helpful and it is common to work jointly early on in the career to make sure clients needs are being handled appropriately.  The hardest part of the job is cold calling and persuading potential clients to take time out of their day to sit down with you and discuss their financial situation.  The most enjoyable part about this job is when you are able to have open dialogue with potential clients about their situation, provide recommendations and build a financial plan that fits their needs. Furthermore, and most importantly to get the clients to take action on achieving financial security and providing a sense of relief in their minds that they are working on a systematic savings plan that will benefit them and their families for a lifetime. Northwestern Mutual was a positive experience for my internship. I learned multiple new skills, and was very impressed with everybody that I encountered within the company. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. No support. Constant quotas and micromanagement  but no salary.Awful. Terrible environment. Paid too little for how  many hours we are supposed to work. Have to have another source of income to survive. The people are very helpful and supportive, and they definitely work hard to help you learn. That being said, a large majority of the job is cold calling your personal connections for recruitment to financial planning within the firm. Being a recent college graduate, it was very hard to successfully recruit clients due to my low credibility. Great company, inspiring role models within, you are left to your own willpower and drive but there are a handful of tasks for new advisors that were very confusing and no one seemed to be able to help or give a clear answer. I worked at Northwestern Mutual for two years as a consultant. I guess the best way to describe their business culture is \"confused\". They will jump into projects without preparation or a clear outcome in mind, ramp up and throw tons of money at a project, only to haphazardly abandon the project before it\\'s completed or tested. After working on a project for a year and obtaining funding to move the project forward, the project was abruptly shelved as they laid-off more than 20% of their workforce to pay for the two new office buildings downtown. Interestingly enough, the company continues to give credit for my work to other employees. They have incompetent employees who are not trained or developed, yet they constantly praise each other for the outstanding work they do. Their field financial offices are given no support or training and feel abandoned by the parent corporation. Northwestern Mutual has a strong focus on technology to support the customer - recently transitioning manual and analog processes to technology driven solutions.  Some might perceive this as a lag in technology due to the lack of resources, financial or managerial support - rather it is due to the ability of satellite offices to continue to provide focused attention to the customer while keeping up with the rapid change in technology and how to utilize it effectively to grow their business.  This means there is a lot of opportunity.  Every employee has an opportunity to participate in solutions and be heard.   You are accountable to continue to educate yourself with (for example) changes in technology and the company provides multiple opportunities to do that.  Northwestern Mutual is involved with and cares about the community and there are many ways to get involved.  Overall Northwestern Mutual is a very solid company and a great place to work. This job was simply instrumental in my development personally and professionally. The opportunity to make tremendous money while helping others can\\'t be matched by any other similar company. You get out what you put in to this company. If you’re willing to diligently put in a lot of hours and follow your mentors to a fault, you will be rewarded accordingly. If you’re looking for a simple 9-5 with average effort, you will not survive more than a couple months. Each day I met with professional financial advisers and spent a couple of hours in the office. I then spent an hour or two calling connections or sending messages via LinkedIn to set up meetings for myself with potential clients. I would have one or two of these meetings in the afternoon and then head home. But by July I was running out of local connections. The process of building a base was difficult as a very young man without much credibility, and few of my connections were willing to share contact information of others (and understandably so). Regardless, I learned a tremendous amount about insurance, sales, and finance in general along with new communication and networking skills. Great people. I was unable to generate the leads needed to provide for a family of 4.  ,The leadership is tireless in their development of reps, and provide honest direct feedback. It was a great experience, every where you turn is great people and all the knowledge you need to succeed is right down the hall way. it just wasn\\'t the best fir for me living off of commission only. As a rep there, It is very competitive to have a fruitful career, however if manage to overcome that, it will become easier for the future. I thank the experience, but will recommend to look into what exactly the position is and if is in your desire. There was no limit on the amount of information an intern could learn. The full time advisors were always willing to sit down and offer their advice to the interns. For me, being able to pick their brain allowed me to learn more about the financial industry than I could have imagined. Great company, nice people to work with.I think it is pretty awesome that they provide lunch for their staff, and they also give employees enough time to enjoy their lunch! Pretty cool!! Great company to start at. Their internship program is top notch and really gives you the skills needed to be successful in any sales driven position. The role was very heavy on sales, with some opportunity to learn. It\\'s like most financial advising opportunities. 85% of the time you spend prospecting for clients... I think the firms should make more of an emphasis on making sure people are well versed in investing and less so in the business (making profits) but I guess that\\'s how the world is... people are so resistant to planning and doing what is needed (procrastination) that convincing people just to sit down and plan takes up most of your time you could be spent perfecting your craft. Positions at Northwestern Mutual are not for everyone. It is very hard work and will put an individual to the test. It will take a lot of time to further yourself in the business, but it is very rewarding in the end if you work for it. Northwestern Mutual will provide you with every resource needed to be successful in your career but it is ultimately up to you to thrive in this industry. Training is focused mainly on insurance planning and reps are expected to learn the investment side on their own. Extremely difficult expectations, but they are achievable if you get off to a fast start. Having an older warm market is a benefit, starting straight out of college is very difficult considering most of your friends and peers do not need planning because they\\'re broke and they do not have a need for insurance. ,The general portfolio of Northwestern Mutual\\'s permanent insurance is hands down the best in the market and the company actually does the right thing. Have to manage your time - most of the job is calling friends and family. ,You are in charge of your outcome. If you want to be a financial advisor then this is a great place for you. It\\'s never easy to sling life insurance and because of the commission nature of the business, you have an incentive to push whole life/universal life products with higher commissions as opposed to simpler and likely more appropriate term life insurance products. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Northwestern Mutual is an amazing company to work for if you have the market and a team to assist you doing so. Northwestern Mutual as a company has provided many opportunities to grow and create financial planning for both its contracted employees and its clients.,The downside to Northwestern Mutual has been its diversity and inclusion. Currently this specified area is lacking within the company and its district offices (mine included) have a huge gap in truly learning how to create better environments and help others achieve and grow regardless of their background, culture and ethnicity. If you are willing to work and have the ambition for advancement, this company is for you.,NM has tuition reimbursement to get your degree.,Many in-house courses to advance your knowledge in the financial industry,In-house advancement,Anyone wanting a career not just a job can advance at NM They don\\'t really care about there employee, if your working for the HO in Milwaukee.  If your working for independent business owners then that a different story. I don\\'t think they used or valued my full potential. They also need health insurance benefits. ,Good company, headquarters employees receive more benefits and they give back to the community. The internship is a way for them to get new clients. They have you call everyone you know to set up meetings and try to sell them on the company\\'s products. It was incredibly uncomfortable for me and many other interns I worked with. They pay $100 a week plus any commission you make. The intern director and everyone else in my office was very friendly and accommodating, but the job itself was miserable. Great learning experience and an awesome opportunity to sell some great stuff. Toughest part of the job is that it is commission only. Its a wild ride. I enjoy the company and the culture and the people at NM; however, I do work there as a contractor. Northwestern Mutual values their employees and is very good to them; however they have VERY high standards. I read someone else\\'s review of the company on another site that said it\\'s a great company IF you can meet their standards & I know exactly what they mean. I\\'ve worked for other companies with very high standards but none of them compare to the expectations that NM has for people. Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work. They hired me to be a contract consultant and I believe would have moved forward with me if it was a position I wanted. The company gave you tools to succeed but you have to really put in a lot of personal time and effort, outside of the office, to succeed in the business. No salary and full commission from the beginning. A typical day involves getting to work by 7:30 morning includes guided meetings and cold calling.  Lunch time and beyond is set aside for meetings, preparing docs, and more calling.  We had to manage and grow our own business.  100% commission job.  Helping people reach their personal and financial goals was my favorite part of the job. NM does not offer a base salary and takes a zero risk investment in its employees by transferring risks including slow sales onto its reps. The company does sell quality products, but the business model creates high barriers to entry if you are starting a new career. If you can make it past 6 months it a miracle.,upper management does get too involved and milk you dry off your Natual market really quick you are forced to do \"joint work\" with experienced advisors only for them to take half of your sale. otherwise, they never talk to you. I was there for 2 years and saw over 25 employees quit. ,The service Staff is a joke and the Nickle and dime you for everything. they \"provide\" 8 year old laptops and if you want one that works you pay for it. ,Training is inconsistent and it everyone has there own set of rules.,no really culture. employees are out on there own a week after starting. While working at Northwestern the culture and people in the business were easy to get along with and were all great people. However the internship requires you to do a lot of cold calling and to call family members for sales. Working for individual financial advisor is fine, but it limits opportunity. Culture is like any other insurance carrier, hard to find good agents but support is really good. This is a good company that provides good products. Job security does not exist. It takes a specific bread to work in the insurance industry/with Northwestern Mutual. Mediocre Company that is trying to be diverse are still struggles I wish nothing but the best for the company however it wasn’t the right fit for me at the time They use new hires to capture their \"circle of influence\" giving employees false hopes of success.  Only 5% stay with the job after a year.  Takes a minimum of 4 years to establish your business.  You need living resources to overcome obstacles until income is generated. The people on teams have got what it takes however they are rarely listened to or valued.  Upper leadership is egocentric and incompetent.  Communication is riddled with corporate speak and actions do not reflect the vision.  There is no trust in the organization. The whole company structure tells you to go out and try and convince people they need their product. They start off by having you make a list of people who are willing to \"help\" you. Then they have you call all your close friends and family on this list and attempt to scam them. Great overall company with open door policy from mentors and upper management. Like most sales positions, you get out what you put in. Company willing to pay for licences and training. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. The firm keeps the clients, Training is run by a failed rep. You are a 1099 independent contractor but they tell you what you have to do or threaten to fire you if you do not listen. The company has great products but a flawed program on how to keep and retain good people. Call all your friends and family and do joint work, when you fail they(joint work) keep the clients. Good people. worked so many hours on commission only. good months and then slow months. This all I want to say about these people, bit there is a minimum amount of characters. Thx Don\\'t intern here unless you have no other options. It is an extremely sink or swim business that has you calling up friends and family constantly to sell insurance. They take all of your dial and meeting numbers and show them to the rest of the intern class and openly rip you if you do not meet their standards. Full commission, 100 dollar stipend a week that they are very reluctant to pay out. They are focused more on what you can produce for them and don\\'t actually care about you the intern and your career advancement. The retention is extremely low 8-9% and you are ultimately a foot soldier salesman for the summer. This internship will only serve as a resume booster. Employees love to brag about how much money they make, have little class. I can honestly say we were promised so many things from this \"Top Ten\" internship, and they certainly did not deliver/ they lied completely. You lose the drive to work very fast once you see and realize all the BS. And if you still try your best and don\\'t get any sales completed by a certain point, they\\'ll fire you anyways before the summer is up. That happened to half the intern class after a few months. Close: Don\\'t do it unless you have to. It helped my resume and aided in landing me a real finance job. That\\'s about all it offers. Oh yeah and they\\'ll pressure you to buy insurance policies as a 20 year old kid who really has no need for them. Its to insure they have their ROI on you. Northwestern mutual is a great place to work, the people are very nice and everyone was accommodating. It has a positive culture with an emphasis on personal and professional development. I would not be the person I am today had it not been for my almost 5 years spent at Northwestern Mutual. ,The toughest part of the job was dealing with the stress of running my own business and working on a commission only basis. ,The most enjoyable part would have to be the people that I got to work with and my manager/mentor. Great place to work, fun yet competitive. Collaborative and focused on creating an atmosphere that sets individuals up for success. Community wants you to succeed Still a great place to work, but recent management changes as part of an acquisition has really changed the culture....including dropping the fixed benefit pension and laying off employees for the first time ever. Excellent company to work at as a young professional. A Fortune 100 company that is a leader the financial services industry. Offering wide variety of services to help you achieve your financial goals. Working at Northwestern Mutual took a great deal of learning and training.  We sold an array of insurance packages that targeted specific clients based on their incomes and retirement expectations. Northwestern allows thousands of college students to join their company every year. They devote time and money in developing sales people to grow the company\\'s size and image. The hours will be long and most interaction in the office is tied to the other interns. I found it hard to seperate my buisnness with my off time. for the last 6 years, NML allowed me to be a better communicator Participated in high level cost-benefit analysis discussions with Clients to determine the best course of action in protect assets and build financial security Its a great company as a whole. But not all of the financial reps can be described as the same........................................................ It was an extremely informative internship. If you are passionate and have a drive for learning finance this might be the perfect internship to get started. I loved NML. Would definitely recommend this company/position FOR THE RIGHT PERSON. Make sure you have a strong network of people to call or you will be fighting an uphill battle. Best for career changers. If you are new to sales, they will teach you how to close deals but it takes time and lots of practice to become fully autonomous. The job can be disheartening as only 10% of your contacts will become a client on average so you must prospect relentlessly. They have a mandatory mentorship program which helps a lot. Was there for about 6 months, then they transitioned to direct-hired staff.  Job was fine while I worked there, doing mostly 2nd shift technical dupport, I have learned this kind of experience is the most expensive lesson.,I worked every day and sold to my family and friends and closed a lot of business but still ended up negative; owing the company at the end because of the client retention and the cost to work in the organization. It was a privilege to work at Northwestern Mutual home office for the past 21 years.  I enjoyed my job fully and felt that my contribution through my work played a part in the success of the compensation department.  I thoroughly enjoyed being the \"go to\" person to resolve field issues and do history research to resolve problems and move the department process forward.  I studied the process of work flow and developed a time efficient and accuracy method of processing in the department.  I was asked by my previous manager to teach the others in the office the techniques for more efficiency in the department.  It is still used today. Very welcoming company. Extremely customer driven. They stand by and uphold their company’s goals and mission by providing in depth personalized insurance plans to fits clients individual needs. Northwestern Mutual has one of the best cultures I have ever been a part of. While the start up is hard work, this job is perfect for those who have an entrepreneurial spirit and are self-starters. The environment is really nice, great colleagues and experience. A lot of training, information to study and learn, the leadership is really welcoming. Do not be fooled, this is more of a life insurance company than a financial company. You will be selling life insurance for most of your first year and are required to meet daily sales and production targets of 40 call a day and 3 sales a week. You are required to tap into your current network of friends and family and I was very uncomfortable being known by my peers as someone using them for professional gain. Some can do really well but many often leave because they can\\'t make any money. A commission-only pay structure can be very lucrative, but also risky as the slow sales cylce of life insurance might mean you won\\'t get paid for a month if you don\\'t consistenty close deals. Don\\'t say you haven\\'t been warned. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Good place to work once you have connections in the industry, great people, great management, and great support. Anyone who wants to work here should be prepared The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet with clients and have a positive and significant impact on their financial lives.  I learned that this is a career that needs to be started at a younger age and with less family responsibility.  The earning potential is outstanding, if you can survive the building your client base phase.  The culture is terrific and very welcoming. The hardest part of this career is being able to reconcile the emotions of rejection, extreme high and lows and be able to build the discipline to make calls, make calls, make calls. I enjoyed my time there and I learned a lot about the Insurance business. The particular agency that I worked with was one of the top performers in the country. Very competitive. It was ok. The location was nice. The staff was friendly. It was just not the career for me. I was looking for something more than cold calls and bothering my family for referrals. Working a straight commission position when you have a family especially as a female is much harder than most other positions.  There aren\\'t a lot of female influencers in the insurance field. You get to make your own schedule so you get out what you put into it. Great mentorship however you have to make a lot of cold calls and they take advantage of your warm market. This company gives interns and full time employees alike the same opportunity to develop and grow a good book of business within the insurance industry. They helped me learn about the many different aspects involved in the financial services industry. I really enjoyed my time with them! This is a great place to work with a lot of opportunity.  The training was exceptional and what I know now compared to when I started is literally night and day. I am very happy I wok here. Incredible experience working with with the firm. Work collaboratively with team members, and also an emphasis on work/life balance. Overall, Northwestern Mutual is a terrific firm. I only worked at NWM during my paid internship for about 10 months while I was in college. I learned how to manage my own book of business and build clientele from the ground up. Typical work day includes a lot of customer service and problem solving for a variety of issues with client policies.  Not the most friendly environment/work culture, everyone says to themselves.  Very\"figure-it-out yourself \" environment, but there are a lot of resources to figure it out.  Great experience to build problem solving skill set. Overall great company to work with many opportunities to grow and learn and become immersed in the culture for protecting client\\'s financial spectrum. Had to train myself, no formal training. Had a constant revolving door of employees and my boss 9 times out of 10 had no idea what he was talking about, didn\\'t know proper protocol. Some co-workers are wonderful and they make the day better, while others are clique and can make you feel uncomfortable. Gaining great networking and business experience. Enhancing my knowledge of risk and monetary management. Develop my own market of potential clients, phone prospects for appointments, meet with them to analyze financial planning and recommend financial products and services based on their needs and goals, such as life insurance and investment products while providing ongoing client service beyond the sale. I was a administrative assistant to a financial adviser.  Upper management was good and easy to reach when necessary. The company\\'s environment is good. Working for a very driven financial adviser is though and very fast paced. Overall I think NWM is a good place to work but it comes with many challenges. Great opportunity for driven and resilient individuals. Continuous sales and product related training. Client facing role. Unlimited earning potential Everyone at Northwestern Mutual is very encouraging and helpful in everyday work tasks. Their internship really helped me learn more about the financial advising field. I would recommend their internship program to anyone. One of the toughest careers I have had. It is what you put into it. You work hard you will be rewarded. Not a career for everyone. But if you make it through the first few years, it could be a career you retire with. It is highly lucrative for top producers. I enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual.  I spent just over 4 years there.  The people and culture are great.,The work and the mission of the company are worthwhile and I embraced it.  ,However, due to a company wide transformation and re-organization many good people were downsized.  ,I do wish the company would have employed more of a \"liquid\" talent framework to re-deploy talent vs laying them off.,But, overall the experience was very positive at NM. Good stepping stone for future career in sales oriented work. Basic skills required, repetitive, and sales-centric. Low level of training, management is out of touch. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. You are asked to call on your family and friends to begin your career. But when you leave none of them are your clients and the managers are counting on this so they can make money off your family. Terrible pyramid scheme. Then they attack you when you leave. They are very vindictive! Great place to work if you want to be your own boss. Intense weekly goals must be met or you will not find yourself there for too long. Great field to learn as it relates to everyone\\'s life and well being. Filled with new tools and upcoming technologies,Northwestern Mutual treats both its employers and contractors in equal fashion.Also a fun place to work and develop management capabilities through meetings. Company hires whomever they can.  That can be a good thing, or a bad thing.  Nice to see some vets in there making things work.  They teach and train the best they can..  The senior folks are great. Work consists of phoning potential clients and having meetings with current and potential clients. Management was effective and clear. The mission of the company is important to everyone. Workplace culture is fun and comfortable. Hardest part of the job is finding more potential clients when starting out. Best part of the job is helping people while getting paid for it. i did not enjoy working for the company. high stress, no leadership, thrown out and sink or swim style. only commission made it very hard to live while trying to get started. 7:30 Internal Training - Sometimes useful,9-10 Call 20 people to set meetings (20 more throughout the day),10:30-5 Meetings or setting meetings,5-8/9 Paperwork/Planning,Management gives little useful guidance other than call more people. Meeting the call quota is fine until you run out of people to call (you\\'ll be calling all your friends and family first). ,The hardest part of the job is pushing people to buy insurance vs focusing on financial planning. The most enjoyable part is the autonomy. (You can autonomously work 60-80 hours per week) The 3 decades that I have spent as a Financial Representative at Northwestern Mutual have taught me the value of taking personal responsibility for meeting goals and achieving timely results. Due to my organizational skills, I work best in a highly-structured organization.,During my 30-year stint as a planner I oversaw all marketing and communications functions of my practice. The strategies implemented under my leadership allowed me to qualify for MDRT numerous times. I have kept involved in the industry as a board member of our local NAIFA organization.,I am a highly driven candidate with a strong will to succeed. I can strengthen your organization, set an example for others and be a team player. Every day at my job we sit and discussed the day to day activities that would be implemented. This discussion takes at least thirty minutes and we worked together as a team. I was able to work out of the comfort of my own home. I learned a lot about communication skills by performing cold calls on a daily basis. My manager and I communicated on a daily basis what my every day goals were and weekly goals. The hardest part was convincing people to talk to my boss about life insurance, especially busy people and people who already had it. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work at my own pace and learning many new skills I was there as an intern to learn about the wealth management business. I was welcomed with open arms and learned a lot about the company and the business as a whole productive and fast paced environment. Great way to learn to work independently and as a team. if you want to learn and grow as a business person and as an advisor it will be an awesome experience This internship was one where I learned a lot about myself as far as balancing work, school, and personal life.  With weekly meetings, we were able to start our days off with goals and keep each other on our toes with competitions. The people at Northwerstern Mutual are great. The material can be hard at times but with the correct attitude, working hard and being passionate it can be a great place for a great career. Was a fantastic place to work initially, now too focused on the latest  trends in company vision. Do not appreciate employees and their heavy workloads. Everyone was very kind and welcoming.I could not ask for a better team ranging from the director to the custodial team, even the IT support team. Never did I feel like I was not wanted or appreciated. It truly felt like a family working there. I think for me the most difficult part was having to attend to the many different work ethics of each individual financial representative. When I found myself frustrated or overwhelmed I had alongside someone dealing with the same amount of stress/workload, which reminded me that I was able to accomplish any task and that I was not alone. Our needs were always met whether it be a computer breaking down or running out of snacks in the office snack drawer. In conclusion, I would have to say having \"family lunch\" as we called it was my favorite along with the monthly birthday lunch provided by the director of the office. She was the best of the best! Make about 40 cold phone calls a day.  Make at least 5 appointments a day. I learn that selling life insurance is very challenging.  Management is great to work with very supportive.  Great work culture.  Not spending very much time with your family and always on the road at people\\'s home.  It was challenging finding new contacts every week.  You work with people on a daily basis and build relationships. Not a place for senior advisors.  The expenses are too high for a new advisor.  They discourage FINRA licensing for at least a year.  Which forces the new rep to leave money on the table or give it to a senior rep.  In either situation the unlicensed rep isn\\'t compensated. Great place to work if you have the friend group or connections to build a market for yourself. Being on 100% Commission can be very hard but very rewarding too. This was a strictly sales job.  I enjoyed working at the company and they had some great people on their team.  This job was just not for me.  I did not have the desire to go out and recruit sales from my friends and family which hurt my chances to be successful. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. For the Northwestern Mutual internship, you are given a lot of freedom for the amount of work that you want to put into it. From Monday-Friday, you have a daily training meeting from 8am to 9:30am and then after that, you are in complete control of your schedule. Working at Northwestern Mutual was a very great learning experience. I was able to meat with clients on a daily basis and assess their goals personally, professionally, and financially. From the clients goals i would build them a comprehensive financial plan and share with them my recommendations, From then we would decide if the relationship should continue and we work together to re-assess their lifestyle on a monthly/yearly basis. I absolutely loved working for this company. They think of the customers first, and are the best in the business for a reason. Annual Meeting is out of this world, and you will feel so great in this position Best part of being in the finanviall industry is all about the right company. Northwestern Mutual is a great company to start a sales career in. One of the best training programs I have ever attended. NW is a great company from the top down. They flew us out to milwaukee for annual meeting and we had a great time. Learned alot during the seminars and had fun on the town. The mission of the company is selling people products. The management is only concerned with metrics and not really concerned about the people who work there. The only benefit was paid time off and a small contribution to a 401(k). ,For a small office the work environment was unnecessarily stressful and petty. ,There are very few opportunities to advance. Raises and increases are not generous. It is a great great to work regarding the financial industry. Competitive environment and fast paced. Management is pretty good. Overall, my experience at Northwestern was positive. Same kind of administrative work everyday. Management only cares about how much money they can make. Although everyone is nice and outgoing - culture is very bad. HR should be more involved, its almost like they\\'re not even there. Barely any benefits, although vacation time increases every year you are there. Although this career wasn\\'t for me, I really appreciated upper management\\'s support and approach to their careers. I have nothing but respect for Northwestern Mutual, and I wish them the best. Went into meetings every morning to learn and grow in the field. Reported numbers to senior reps and received feedback on our performance. Started dialing from 9-10 to set meetings. Studied for a couple of hours and then took lunch. After lunch I go out and have meetings throughout the rest of the day until 6. If anyone is a people person, good at sales, and know lots of wealthy people they could make a haul in commission. If you only know limited people, are an introvert, or only know lower class people, you will need a night job to pay your bills. The company is awesome if you are good at sales, if not don\\'t bother applying. They expect 85% of the new advisors to fail. It\\'s a grind with making an average of 200 plus cold calls a week. Poor economy doesn\\'t help and older reps can be snakes. All new reps are encouraged, practically forced, to work with veteran reps on \"big cases.\" These are high potential leads that come usually from the new guy\\'s family and friends. Then the vet rep runs the show and take 70-80% of the commission. I cannot say one bad thing about this company.  They care for their representatives, their staff, and each and every client the are able to help and the ones that they cannot. Northwestern Mutual agents are well trained and most will do an excellent job for their clients. Although, the training is consistent for one office to the next, the office culture will differ, so do your homework and choose wisely! As a whole, a great place to learn the business. Although it wasn\\'t quite the right fit for me, the skills I learned at Northwestern Mutual will stick with me throughout my professional, financial, and personal life. Northwestern Mutual is great at selling Life Insurance. But, with regards to job satisfaction, benefits, and compensation, expect to struggle during your first few years. The commission only compensation encourages selling rather than helping clients and management does not encourage improvement or advancement through licensing in securities. Nice warm,  team oriented atmosphere.  100% cold calling.  Great place to work, but you must be thick-skinned because the majority of people you speak with are not interested in financial planning. This is an exciting and important time to be a part of Northwestern Mutual. We\\'re strong, innovative and growing; we want you to grow with us. People are the power behind Northwestern Mutual, and diversity makes that power even greater. We are committed to providing a diverse, inclusive environment where all of us can realize our individual potential. I had a great mentor that helped me with lead generation, building my book of business and tracking my activity. The administrative staff was also very helpful. A large very conservative financial services and insurance company is attempting to change its structure to become a fast moving nimble start-up style comapany Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. More sales than I anticipated and largely dependent on how many people you know willing to buy insurance to give you a good start.  It generally takes too much time to get on your feet and in a groove than I was able to allow and also too much time away from your family.  The people you work with a great, want you to succeed, and they also seem to generally be happy. I learned a lot and had a good experience, even with a small sample size. I only worked one summer but felt like part of the team. Everyone was their own boss but it still felt united. For the most part I enjoyed working for NWM but it definitely isn\\'t for everyone. The workplace culture is excellent and the people are what make it great but the lack of structure was a little too much for me. The business structure is different and wouldn\\'t recommend this to anyone who really isn\\'t into sales. They claim to do a lot of \"financial planning\" against advisers who only strive to invest your money but it\\'s really just an excuse to promote life insurance. Joined the firm as a Rep. As it is typical in the industry, particularly with the firms which came out of the life insurance agency models, we were coached to compile a project-100 (family and friends) to call, prospect, and ask for referrals. As I was not local, it was particularly challenging. It is often said that the first two or so years starting out as a financial advisor is difficult. Portland Northwestern Mutual office has great training programs and general culture is okay. It would also be helpful to get to know who your potential \"director\" would be - as each team runs differently and the personality of the right director will be beneficial for the aspiring new rep. I always hold this position in high regards. This was the best job I\\'ve ever had and this is where i grew the most in my career. The only issue I had was that it\\'s a commission only position and my practice hit a rough patch at a time when I absolutely needed money. Would go back in a heart beat if I could. The culture and support in our office is incredible. The best part of the financial advisor career is the impact you have on your clients and the lifestyle you can create for you and your family. There is no secret to be successful here other than discipline and hard work. For the right person, Northwestern Mutual is an incredible career. Great place to work at. You get to work with a lot of great people who are always willing to help you out. There is also room for improvement within the company Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work at granted you are willing to dedicate a lot of your time to it. 40 hour work weeks are standard but when it comes to client sourcing and education you are expected to put in after hour work. Advancing your certifications is the utmost priority there and this requires countless after hour work in order to accomplish. Staying late is a regular occurrence. Overall, a great place to work but high stress and unpaid after hour work is expected. This job is not easy, but the potential rewards are worth it. You are given the guidance of senior staff of the company, but you are able to create your own days and hours. It takes a good amount of time to build a client base, and most people don\\'t make it. The people that do, however, reap what they sow for a long time. Unless you have a very affluent natural market that is willing to help you reach others who have the disposable income to purchase financial products you will have a very difficult time being successful. This job is great, however, there is no guaranteed income.  It does hurt not having that steady paycheck.  I found myself struggling to bring in money when my market went dry.  I enjoyed my co-workers and they all pushed me to be successful. Northwestern Mutual is a great first experience into a career of corporate America.  It gives its interns the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of the insurance industry, and grow professionally as a career-driven employee. Good place to break into the financial services industry.  Good place to get licensed and go a different direction.  That was just my experience as people in the AFA role are working directly for an advisor so each advisor will vary. Great for sales driven individual. Provides individuals with an opportunity to create your own business to meet your lifestyle. Can work hard and profit or work just enough to get by. Up to you whether you succeed or not! This career is lucrative for those with a great network of people. If you are going into this without a great pre-existing network, this may be more of a cold-calling and difficult position. However, the training is thorough and definitely teaches you the process of financial planning. Only join this internship opportunity if you\\'re interested in sales, otherwise you will not enjoy your time here. You will have to commit a lot of time for training and getting certified even before the job. The 200 call sheet is real so only join if you love cold calling. Overall a very challenging internship but you are compensated. Very professional work environment, highly structured, good work-life balance. Lots of room to grow and make more money if you become a financial advisor with the company. Company is great, management is great. You get out what you put in. Allows for a flexible schedule if you are efficient. There are plenty of opportunities to learn and grow The drive and care that is in the culture of this company is incredible. I enjoyed being a part of it but at the end of the day, the work just was not for me. I was very sad to leave but it was an incredible experience and I highly recommend it. They definitely help prepare you to succeed. You control your future in this business. If you have a strong desire to succeed it is possible with this company. You make your schedule and can work from home. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. The job allowed you to create your own schedule which was really nice. I would on average have 3 meetings a day with clients. I would be on the phone for about an hour a day on top of meetings A typical day at work is to have a meeting with mentors about sales and activity goals. You are expected to make at least 40 calls per day and schedule 25 meetings per week. This is supposed to be your own financial practice so all business development, most expenses associated with having your own business, and marketing is all on you. Sales goals are extremely hard to continuously meet and there is about a 5% retention rate of new reps. This company is built like a pyramid scheme and they prey on interns and make it sound great until you get there and they use you.They get interns to get leads and they take them. I was in the internship program, all hands on learning and overall an awesome experience. Great mentor-ship, great culture, great work environment. All initiative and hard work. You get out what you put in. The financial representative internship shows you how to build relationships but also forces you to sell to friends and acquaintances. Not the most pleasant experience for someone without a strong natural network. I enjoyed being a CFR here! The environment was helpful for an incoming student that wanted to learn how to find and generate sales. This is a position for someone looking to find success on their own- must be willing to step out and find contacts/sales. Still working through growing pains of becoming a more digitally-driven, planning-centric CX company. Have lost some talent in the past few years because of the churn. Since each financial advisor is an independent contractor what you are paid and benefits vary team to team. You could make much much more working for one advisor doing the same amount of work compared to another. Working for the agency is not desirable as agency employees are overworked and underpaid for what they do. There is a cap on what you can go to within a specific team or within the agency, great entry level starting point. This company provides a lot of opportunity to learn about the industry. You deal with clients and building personal relationships. There is minimal support while starting your career (which takes several years). Northwestern Mutual is a well established, well respected company with over 150 years of history. A life insurance company in the beginning, they expanded to include financial advisory services in the 1920\\'s and currently have over $138 Billion is assets. Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work for. I met a lot of great people. I would recommend this company to others. The culture is a friendly atmosphere. I wasn\\'t to pleased with this company. They use college students as instruments to gain new clients such as their friends and family. Once we lose people to reach they let us go. I never doubted how great Northwestern Mutual was as a company, but working as a Financial Representative backed by them was not quite what I expected. I knew the position was commission based and that did scare me a little, but everything I heard going into the position was as long as I work hard and use the information that is provided in training I will have a good start and then I would just have to keep up the momentum. I cannot speak for every office, but the office where I worked had several very successful Financial Representatives. The problem here was that they were extremely busy with all of their own work, so joint-work with them would at times be very difficult to set up. Also, several of these experienced representatives didn\\'t want to take the time on the \"little fish.\" These facts, along with my network not being in the same state as my office did not produce a good start, which lead me to feel like I didn\\'t belong. I enjoyed the new opportunities to learn at this company.  They were very open to sending me to training and it was a very worthwhile venture to obtain my insurance license for this opportunity. I only worked here for a summer while in college. I really did not have much of a chance to put much effort into the job as I went to summer school. The way this program was set up is to use college kids as a referral base to the other reps whereby parents and relatives would likely sign up for insurance products if their kids were working there. The rep would get an 80 percent cut and the intern 20. PTO is given to employees, but there are no available days to take off.  Very little coaching support.  Not a very supportive environment.  There is no work/life balance. This is the worst place I have ever worked.  All levels of leadership are terrible.  I wouldn\\'t even advise someone to be a policy owner at NM.  The current leadership regime will run this company into the ground. Lack of direct contact with boss.  Had to learn on your own.  Considerable client contact, proposals,  multiple projects in fast pace  environment.   Maintain accurate and detailed client records, responding to client inquiries. -Great Mentors,-Great opportunity to grow,-Always being motivated by mentors, peers and top management to work hard,-Very hard work, but if you put in the time you will be very successful. the opportunity is very good if you are willing to work hard. appleton is a hard location to make it work but the people are very friendly and helpful. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. It was an ok job that had less than ok pay. Lots and lots of training and then not a lot of help once you’re out on your own. They micromanage everything and if you’re interested in moving up forget about it. Working at Northwestern Mutual was a great experience. At the end of the day it is a simple job...but it is not easy. You need to be able to thrive in the fast paced environment and be self motivated to go above and beyond what you are taught in order to be successful. There will never be an end in learning and applying new skills. A great opportunity for anyone who is feeling stagnant and looking for a daily/weekly challenge. I do not recommend this internship. They do not provide you with leads, you will have to provide your own. You will be required to sell life insurance to your friends and family. Everyone can do this job but it is not for everyone. You have to be motivated to make your own business and essentially you must really enjoy sales. This isn\\'t the most analytical job but rather and sales job. You will be asked to call all your closest friends and family to help build your client base. If this makes you uncomfortable than this probably isn\\'t the job for you. I think it\\'s a good company with good intentions but it\\'s just the nature of this business to have to stay on the phone and call asking for meetings. Working as a technical support analyst was a stepping stone in my IT career. , It was draining to have to take calls all day and it helped me realize that this is not ideal position for me. I despise phone positions now. It was an intense learning experience and I enjoyed my autonomy for my health and well-being. Northwestern Mutual supports over 10,000 field reps and when I worked there. God forbids anything breaking because you will be on the phones from the time your shift starts until your shift finishes which could cause mild depression if you come across multiple angry field reps who needed their computer fixed yesterday.,The most enjoyable about this job is the fact that I was able to learn various issues. It really gave my opportunity to put my brain to work before it got boring.,The down fall is that management just look at SLA stats and nothing else when the decide to promote you which could take up to a year or more. Even if you are meeting the metrics they will place you in other ques without additional pay. The turn-around is very high. Most techs are only there for a few months before they move on.,I would spend no more than 6 months as a Tech Support Analyst at this company. Build the valuable skills you need and get out. Don\\'t think twice or you will be disappointed. They will not hesitate to fire you at any moments time. I loved every minute of working with Northwestern Mutual. It\\'s difficult job which isn\\'t meant for everyone but as long as you give it your all, you should be successful Great work/life balance opportunity,Learned a lot about myself and the industry of financial services,Had to call on family and friends which was uncomfortable,Overall not for everyone, and is what you make of it They hire you so the higher up representatives can take all of your hard work once the internship ends. They make you call family and friends and put you in awkward positions. Not much room for long term career advancement opportunities. No benefits. Company keeps temps on for long periods of time with no hope for permanent placement. if you want to be successful in the financial service business, you must start your day with a plan, learn how to manage your time, and don\\'t let fear stand in your way! A very difficult job, especially starting out. Only got commission, and if you don\\'t know anyone it could take a long time to make a sale. The culture is very competitive. Exciting opportunity at first until you learn about the culture and the huge turnover of employees in some network offices. Very scary and no job security if you work in a network office as you are contracted to the managing partner directly. Working in a network office also means there is no HR you can turn to in case you are not being treated the way you should. Whether you stay with the network office or not really depends on the managing partner liking or not liking you anymore and you have no support. Run and run fast if you have a sliver of a personality! Team leads are awful, middle management ok, upper management near invisible. Audits contain no semblance of common sense whatsoever, they’re devised to funnel money upwards. If you approach this issue, they have “language” for everything and scripted responses. Be ready to be treated as a 5 year old who needs to learn a lesson. This is the culture of management they promote there, especially team leads. The best is they actually show concern at the employees leaving, like they’re worried there will be some backlash. But nobody leaving cares enough!  Joke of a company. Need to get over themselves and their free lunch. Not worth it. Not much room for growth. There was nothing to gain from working here. I wasted my time. And the mission was not followed at all. Im looking for better It was a good company to work for learned a lot of financial information to help with financial planning. Meeting with persons who had questions about there financial goals and how to reach them were beneficial. Working for Northwestern Mutual is a different kind of experience. As an independent financial representative, you work with the company but have full control over your own schedule. You make your own calls to clients, hire your own staff, are responsible for setting your own meetings. You meet with clients to discuss wholistic financial planning and can impact their lives. It is a great opportunity for people who are disciplined and hard working. Northwestern Mutual is a fast-paced, exciting work environment with many opportunities for both personal and professional growth. The insurance and financial advisement field is always growing and changing.  This is a company where learning and growing your human capital is a constant. Wouldn\\'t do it again, I wasn\\'t at all a fan of my manager and the way he chose to run things and treat his employees. Felt like there was an inappropriate intersection between personal and professional life. Analyzed financial information obtained from clients to determine strategies for meeting clients\\' financial objectives. Reviewed clients accounts and results regularly to determined whether life changes, economic developments or financial performance indicated a need for a plan revision. Implemented financial planning recommendations. If you are an advisor, you will be fine.  Tough for a woman on staff to advance.  Sexist leadership locally.  Nationwide the company is amazing.  Poor local leadership. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. NML cares about its employees. It is a great place to develop and grow a career. NML is a bit of a slower pace work environment; however, so if you plan to work here for an extended period of time and then leave to a faster pace company, be prepared. Vice vera; if you come from a fast pace work enviorment, you will learn to be patient and take more time for yourself. Try not to get frustrated with that if your expectations are different. Employer that takes care of the employees. Fun and relaxing place to work. Managers are fair. The culture and the environment is great and it\\'s very diverse. The company respects agents/salespeople more than admin workers. Although the admin is needed to make the organization run, the employees are not treated well. They will position your career as a full pledge financial planner (even though you cannot call yourself that until you have obtained the CFP designation. However you are just in the business of selling life insurance. You sell insurance, cold calling which is never fun. I would not recommend unless you like making calls. Glad i had the opportunity to find out that this wasn\\'t for me. Typical day included several meetings with potential clients as welkl as office administration. On Site gym, and management was very knowledgeable as well as having been promoted internally, Unless you desire to be an FA this is just an ok place to work. If you are trying to be an FA they are very supporting and have good training programs. Able to work in the office or at home,Heavy work load in order to become successful, like any company ,Personable management, willing to work with and help new employees ,Sink or swim,Large learning curve On a daily basis, I would respond to policy request via email, phone and written correspondence. I would also assist with filing and clerical duties as well. NML uses a variety of contractors to staff their help desk that supports their field agents.  Contractors are viewed as expendable and the bar for success is quite high.  They focus entirely on job metrics to the detriment of morale and actual productivity.  They would likely get better results if they relaxed their demands and considered other aspects than call metrics. I was an independent insurance agent with Northwestern Mutual for five years and a client for over 40 years. A really great firm. I left them to return to my main lifetime career as a Registered Investment Advisor in my own firm, which was a legal conflict with a continued relationship with Northwestern Mutual Insurance. See Above,Tons of Flexibility once you prove yourself, 90% of people are fantastic,Commission Base comp for advisors, can be like drinking through a fire hose for new hires The most enjoyable part about the job, was being able to satisfy the customer and representatives. I learned how to cut checks globally, typical day is filing, answering phones, responding to emails, cutting checks and utilizing my skills. If you are a dedicated person and can build your own schedule then you would do great working for them. They allow you to be flexible but the less you work the less you make. So there is really not a typical day at the office since each day is completely different. Some day I can have as many as 5+ meetings schedule; while others I have only 2 meetings schedule. Learning wise, I have learn a lot both about myself and about where my overall vision for my future is. Workplace culture is great since people here are supportive of each other. Hardest part of my job would have to be dealing with some people who wants more profit for the company but don\\'t understand that profit without satisfaction lead nowhere in the future.  Most enjoyable part of my job would be the people who I have the pleasure to get to interact with on a daily basis. I like the temp position once job was offered to me I had found something else.  I liked working there but was looking for something a little closers to bus rides. Daily I stayed current with the most important financial products and trends so that I could help enhance my existing client\\'s financial situation.  It was a privilege to identify great individuals I wished to work with, gain a referral, and earn their business! I felt more like a pushy salesperson than I did a financial adviser. there was a very pushy sales culture and highly focused on reaching numbers. interesting marketing techniques, by using people close to you and using word of mouth. I learned a good bit, but was not the right job for me. I did the Northwestern Mutual internship and it was definitely a learning experience that I would not recommend. You are required to bug your friends and family until they buy from you and introduce you to their friends and family as well. The college interns are told that they are \"Financial representative\" and Full-time employees are \\'Financial advisors,\" but the truth is that they are all insurance salesman. The financial advising they offer is to put everyone they can into term, or whole life insurance as an investment. As a full-time employee, you take your series 6 and 63 to sell investment products but the fact is this is an INSURANCE company that sells some investment products as well.,I did not have a good experience with this internship, there was little guidance and bad leadership. Also, was a lack of integrity with a lot of the salesman. They would get people to buy more insurance than what they need so they can pad their pockets with more commission, even if that meant putting less money into their retirement accounts. ,If you are interested in this company it is a good learning experience, but they also misconstrue the position to seeming more lucrative and easier to do than what it is. I would not recommend but if you are interested be wary of what to look out for. The job highly requires you to contact your personal network to set up meetings to sell life insurance. If you have a small network, it is extremely difficult and success is unlikely. This position would be great with a strong personal network. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Helped with kitchen duties and also dishwasher duties. assisted customers with getting their lunch. Filling up coffees and sugars. Help plate trays. Assisted the disabled with carrying their trays and getting food. Cleaning out food area. Cleaning out dishwashing machines and equipment. By far the worst leadership in any business I\\'ve ever worked for. Not just saying that to be malicious. It was a free for all, and no guidance. There was just a vibe of \"I\\'m above you\" mentality. Good company to learn a new industry and IT upgrades. IT engineers are great.  There are ton a great managers who are welcoming and open. However there are a lot of staff that are not interested in change or seem to not care at all. Northwestern offers the best outside sales training that I\\'ve ever seen, and I have been through several sales trainings with other companies. They used the One Card System when I was there, and I still use it to this day.  Nice people, you make it what you want there. The job is difficult because you are entrepreneur and in charge of your own business. Although the company offers good training it lacks on going training in developing new representatives. Also it seems like out the office I worked out of, there were people they wanted to succeed and provided them with the tools to do so. Currently work at this company.  I work with advisors throughout the company. A lot of middle management - company going through many changes. Beautiful new facility. You can become super successful with NM but you will need a lot of good, qualified and wealthy contacts willing to do financial planning or buy insurance from you when you start. Because you wont know anything when you start, and you wont be licensed yet to do the investments yourself,  you are forced to bring on the veteran reps to your appointments... and split the commission credit with them. All of your expenses are covered your first few years, but you better bank up enough renewable commission so that when they start charging you rent space, make you pay for your office staff and  your commission credits decrease, that you can still stay working and make any money. ,The veteral reps basically run the show. Some of the reps can say or act any way they want, treat new people or women any way they want to and if they are a large producing rep, no one will do anything about it. Northwestern was an exciting atmosphere that gave individuals the chance to rise beyond expectations. I really enjoyed my time there and if I would have followed through with it I believe it could have been incredibly beneficial. Opportunity to build your own schedule and create your own success based on the amount of effort put into it. Perfect learning opportunity and chance to connect with business professionals. The company is a well positioned and well managed company with a leadership team that cares about the little guy. The area manager once hired me in high school to do manual labor and joined me in the hot Texas sun because he wanted to pitch in on his own task. It was very difficult. I would recommend going into this career with a savings account that can pay your bills for a minimum of 6months. This career can be very lucrative but it takes time. You will make very little in the beginning while you are getting the hang of selling insurance. Autonomy, flexible hours and high degree of pay. Great coaches and great mentors. Online Company website has great resources to practice, learn and educate yourself. This is a great company for those who want to learn more about the financial industry but are still enrolled in school. They also pay for you to get your license and offer paid continuing education to renew licenses. Great place for Business students to get adjusted to what the real world is like. very demanding but worth it if you can hang in there.  Can easily make 100k after graduation. Northwestern is a company which will give you all the necessary tools to obtain your FINRA licenses in a short amount of time. The organization culture and compensation is extremely poor however. This job is only appropriate for those with a significant amount in emergency savings as well as an affluent network or \"natural market,\" as they refer to it. The old method of networking through your natural market is a dying one, and unless your network is high-income, you will struggle to survive financially at Northwestern. Loved my experience but they do not do much for the new hires except train them on how to be a Northwestern Employee. You must have strong ties to financial stable adults or have no problems with cold calling anybody in order to create your leads and client list. There are no boundaries to a market, you must simply figure out who you want to pitch to, and go do it. Strictly commission during my time, which I do not prefer. I enjoyed working on several initiatives, and developed quite a large network through two contracts at Northwestern Mutual.  If offered a permanent position at Northwestern Mutual, I absolutely would accept! A rich learning experience where I was able to develop a variety of skills on a daily basis. Developed strong relationships with the many employees of Northwestern Mutual and felt like a part of something bigger than myself. The job varies depending on which financial representative you work for if in salary again depends on what agent you work for depending on how high up in the later they are how further along in your career You are basically on your own after 4 weeks of training.  They are more so concerned about life/disability insurance than investments.  The most enjoyable part is working with other financial advisors Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. preparing paperwork assisted new agents with starting they career, new management, lack of training, lack of leadership which leads to a failing company Northwestern Mutual is a fantastic company that truly focuses on making you a success. They provide you with tools and training to succeed as long as you commit to doing well. Provided good working conditions and encouragement in Innovation. Best team work and helps in improving the skills and enhances the working conditions with smart and easy way of work Good Working environment. Very good benefits. 8:30-5:00 work day with an hour lunch.  Great boss and co workers.  Great support from our home office in Milwaukee. Poor work life balance. Managers ask about your ambitions but work to prevent movement within the company if you\\'re of any value to the current department. Benefits have definitely taken a nose dive in the recent years with primary doctors that use to be covered not anymore with limited options outside of Milwaukee. Expectations set by management and the business are often out of touch with what the engineers state are obtainable with the end result of the expectation that you are available to work 24 hours a day. The culture at Northwestern Mutual was great - everyone around the office was eagerly willing to help out and offer insight. Prospecting is a challenge, especially in areas that have lots of financial advisors who attend the same kinds of networking events. Referrals are the main source of building a client base, which can be difficult for those coming out of school with a relatively non-established network - career changers can excel here. The training is good, but it is focused on the products more so than the financial planning process. The mentorship is designed to help with the planning process, but not all mentors are equal. Loved the culture, but as a 100% commission based role, it can be difficult to succeed (average turnover is about 85%). Although I worked in a satellite office, we dealt with the Home Office in Wisconsin regularly.  Very professional work environment with lots of training and an entrepreneurial emphasis. Job security, plenty of employment opportunities, multiple site locations,  24hr employment hours ( jobs for all shifts),  full benefits, great pay, weekly paychecks. This position helped push me as a person and move past my self-expectations. It allowed me to understand more about financial planning for the future and the importance of insurance. good internship that allowed me to succeed in business. They do hire you without mentioning the main job description. I do not like how the internship is not paid. If you like a sales job that’s 100% commission and sitting at a cubicle cold calling all day then you’ll like being a financial rep. That’s not how this job was presented to me. The company has good training and a communicative support network. Most people you work with are great and I found some good friends from this position. The job is pure commission based sales. Expect a lot of cold calling and creating your own book of business. I definitely improved my phone skills and scheduling skills from this position. Program was not helpful in assisting me with work,Was not provided with useful resources,Very independent work, training they provided was not very hepful for job I loved the Financial Rep I worked under/with but the job was monotonous and too sedentary for me. Good experience gained and would have received a promotion had I chose to stay but sometimes good pay and nice people are just not enough to compensate for the lack of training, boredom, and person distaste for the daily tasks. If you like a sales job that’s 100% commission and sitting at a cubicle cold calling all day then you’ll like being a financial rep. That’s not how this job was presented to me. The great place to work at. I felt secure about my future. My co-workers were great people. They helped me to grow a lot. The managing partners and managing directors are very professional, hard-working and trustworthy. I appreciate everything this company has done for me. I would have never left if i wwas able to grow there as an accountant. (the accounting field is in the other city) I was only an intern at Northwestern Mutual for 1 semester in college, but with my time there, I learned professional development in my transition from the military to the civilian sector. Never-ending work day. No matter how long or hard you work, they don\\'t value you. ,There is no opportunity for growth. They will tell you what you want to hear to keep you working hard, but no follow through in development. Working as a Financial Adviser requires a diverse and wide personal network. You must possess exceptional sales skills to be able to sign your friends and family as clients. A vast majority of your business will be through referrals, which can only be obtained after satisfying the insurance needs of people you already know. As an intern the program with Northwestern was extremely educational and immersive. You\\'re shown the ropes by an established financial representative who doubles as a mentor and are showed first hand an amazing corporate culture. I traveled to Milwaukee and various towns in my state for conferences and seminars. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. NML wa great from day one. Always customer focused/driven extremely responsive to staff needs and requirements. Customer satisfaction is paramount. Well thought out strategic planning At this time I don\\'t care to share any experience. I will say that the culture of the company is revolving.  The company is very flexible and will work with your needs. There is always room for growth and opportunities for advancement.  They offer tons of classes and peers to work with you to reach the career goal you are looking for Northwestern Mutual really gave me the tools to succeed. If you are a go getter you can do well in this environment. You will be selling life insurance as well as the other financial services they offer. Northwestern Mutual allows you to keep your own entrepreneurial-like schedule.  A typical day involves phoning, scheduling, and meeting with clients.  The firm really focuses on development to help people grow their practice. Northwestern Mutual is not client focussed. It is all about selling whole life insurance products. Whole life is for some people but it is not for everyone.... NM does not understand that. I loved working for NM, coaching was important to me and I had that available to me at all times. The also promote professional growth and friendly workplace I felt the the entire premise of the internship was just to generate extra sales for the specific branch. I didn\\'t receive much guidance and was just told to start making clients on my own. There was no help or assistance I was just told to come in every day and try to make as many insurance sales that I could. Normal office hours would be spent calling potential clients. I personally did not enjoy this, but if you are good at it then it can be very profitable. I would be required to go into the office once a week and each of those days I established a list of people I would call and I would talk to them to see if they were interested in learning more about the company and the different types of plans we could offer them. Commission only, tough to start with a family. If you’re ok with being commission only from day 1 then this is a great career for you. Can make 200k per year working 3-5 years Everyone at the local level is related and getting along with the local franchise owners can be challenging as most are not well experienced or educated. Changing culture in the last year to hiring young employees and moving away from long term retention of employees. Drastic change in the 160 year culture at Northwestern Mutual. Manage your time well, learn to deal with difficult clients and be able to move on with a positive attitude even after hearing the word \\'no\\' countless times. Cold calling means quotas need to be hit at the end of each month After experiencing Northwestern Mutual, I cannot offer too much in the realm of positivity. Any insurance company who pushes Whole Life Insurance onto ignorant consumers (or \"clients\") deserves to be treated as scum. It has a great company culture. They\\'re very understanding towards students. They should market their financial representative internship a little less, since it makes them seem like they have low standards. Otherwise it\\'s a nice company. I met lifetime friends there, PTO was nice too. When I started there the lunch was great but the menu items change for more healthy selections. Free gym. It is a very fraternity type atmosphere where if you are one of the chosen you are given more latitude, but if you are anything else you are shown the door quickly. I was an unpaid intern. It was a comfortable environment with a friendly, cooperative, knowledgable staff that were very willing to share their expertise with me. I was fortunate to have interned at this company while I was attending college in New York City. I was a part of the development team and handled a multitude of tasks. I was in direct contact with all of the C-level suite managers and learned a lot from the exposure I was afforded. Northwestern is a great company that has a very solid reputation on the financial world.,As a rep you start out by truly just selling insurance. Some consider themselves financial advisers but in all reality they are just selling insurance. ,The guys that have been around 5+ years are actually advisers and do good planning. ,Some of the leadership in the Houston office is ehh but as a whole there are some really good people that work there and do really care about others. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. We work for the rep and the rep has a lot of authority over how he/she treats his/her employees. There are no HR options that can handle a cruel/inappropriate rep. I was the fourth person in my position in a year. I stayed for 2 years and quit to go back to school. I can honestly say that it was some of the most stressful and emotionally exhausting months of my life. My rep thought nothing of verbally and emotionally abusing me and my co-workers loudly/publicly. I was warned about him by multiple people in the office. NM staff either could not or would not curb his behavior. Unacceptable. Awesome working underneath a senior financial advisor.  Great exposure to the business and a very relaxed work environment.  Fun group in the office as well. The typical day varies greatly since every agent\\'s schedule is left completely up to themselves. Personally, I would make dials in the morning as I tried to get in touch with referrals and other contacts, followed by meetings in the afternoon, and finally bookkeeping matters before I went home. ,I have worked in two different offices, with the first having a wonderful atmosphere of friendship and support, and the second being slow and somber. ,While agents do not have bosses, I have had multiple mentors, all of whom have been supportive, available and helpful.,I found setting meetings with people you know (even those you know well) with the hopes of talking about personal finances to be quite difficult. You get their early in the morning and proceed with a daily meeting about objectives, different techniques, and reiterations about your goals and objectives day to day. Work culture is very professional. Fully commissioned paid job. It\\'s been too long since I worked at Northwestern Mutual to fairly assess what it\\'s currently like to work there.  The best I can say is that employees are generally satisfied. Great experience during my summer here, learned a lot. The experienced people in the company are very willing to teach and help grow the young employees. It was a good overall place to work. Benefits are very good, and the culture has changed for the better. Upper management could communicate and motivate staff better. You’ll get out of it what you put into it. ,If you want to pursue being an advisor for them, they give you every resource and opportunity to succeed. They need to focus a little bit more on what systems and applications need to be upgraded to help the technology coordinators in the field.  There is room for growth, but  they relay on a failed system to chooses if you succeed and not on hard work and success. It was a good learning experience for an office job. It allowed me to get my insurance license, and learn about this type of industry. It showed me what it would take to perform in a commission based job. It allowed me to determine the path to take in job hunting. Amazing culture and values. Great experience!! I learned how to interact with clients and build relationships. A typical day at work would be making phone calls and seeing people. Too much pressure, too much non reimbursed travel for training, and this company hires anybody. No drug screen, didn\\'t ask for my resume, and while learning about the company, I strongly disagreed with some of the people and their views on how to do their job. Northwestern Mutual has been one of the greatest learning experiences of my life. I was taught management skills, time efficiency skills, and communication skills. A typical day at Northwestern Mutual consists of a training and development meeting lead by the Chief Development Officer. This is to review activity and productivity to assure our team is remaining on track. I would then sit down with my mentor and review my specific numbers for the prior week and also for the week ahead of me. This is to make sure my numbers align with my weekly and monthly goals. After my training and development, I begin to dial the phone and set meetings. My personal goal is to dial 20 people a day, and also set 5 meetings a day. That brings me to 25 meetings ahead each week. After my phoning, I attend my meetings I have set for that day. ,The workplace culture is incredible. The people at Northwestern Mutual are always willing to help. I have made life long friends within my company. The culture of Northwestern Mutual consists of hard working individuals that truly have each and every one of their clients best interest at heart. ,The hardest part about my job is selling a product that most people do not necessarily want to think about purchasing. This is because Life and Disability insurance benefits are mostly exercised in unfortunate circumstances. As a financial representative, it is my job to explain to a client the importance of protecting assets along with their family in the event of a death or disability, and then simply encouraging clients to want to own these products. ,The, most enjoyable aspect of my job is knowing I am truly helping people create a financial plan to best suit their wants and needs. I have been able to help many people I love and care about begin planning for their futures in the most efficient ways possible. I have also truly enjoyed learning more about asset management and investment based planning. I have learned so much already about finance and have been taught by the best team out there! Great company, great staff, and well rounded culture. Plenty of advancement opportunities. Very moral, ethical, closely knit culture. Driven by the company slogan and customer service. In office calling and setting up meeting.  Reviewing curent meetings and discussing options with future and curent clients. Meeting new people is the most injoyable. Day by day you strive to be the hardest working version of yourself. Northwestern Mutual gives you all the tools to create a sound financial practice. Terrible pyramid scheme for interns. I\\'m sure being a fully licensed FA at Northwestern is a good career path (MAYBE) but absolutely do not do this internship. All they want is your family and friends before you quit. I worked as an intern at NWM. Basically they hire everyone they can and make you reach out to friends and family. The senior advisors make money off of those people and then kick you to the curb if you are not selling enough life insurance. Great experience and education. Company culture is very friendly and pleasing. There is a lot of self-drive necessary to become successful, but it is very positive. Only downside is that there is no base salary; i.e. 100% commission. Working at NM has been a fruitful experience, but there is really not much variety within your job. Also, career advancement is minimal to none. Tough to move around or up in the office, you can expect to be doing the same job 5 years from now. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. I very much enjoyed my time during the internship with Northwestern Mutual. They are very transparent in their communication, help a young individual learn what the financial planning industry is all about, and make sure they get the most of their people. I would recommend this opportunity to anyone who wants to know what running your own business and the sales environment is all about. Pros:,-Essentially make your own hours,-Learn the ins and outs of the business,Cons:,-Commission based pay makes it hard to earn consistent income, especially when starting off,-If your natural market is not large you will struggle with making calls,-High expectations for dials, meetings, and cases every week they do not follow their mission statement. the company will break moral values to make board members happy and to satisfy obligations to board member companies. The Boca and PGA office is positive and pushes you to be better. You have a lot of support and the staff are professional and friendly. Utilize the training and joint partner work as you will develop more in this field. Although I enjoyed my time at NWM. I left to continue to give baseball a go. I did very well on the insurance selling side of things. But I had no desire to be a financial adviser. Good if you have the proper network. Not so good if not. They show you the compensation of the highest earning reps to lure you in and make it seem easily obtainable. Great sales and communication experience was acquired while working at this company. in order to succeed in this organization, you must be able to think outside the box, have a thick skin for sales and rejection, and requires plenty of sales/communication skills. Work on contract for multiple years and always got renewed but never hired. Expectations are high but sometimes opinions or recommendations were ignored. Good benefits , training , resources , etc . Enjoyed my job and time at northwestern mutual as well as learning many new things. I would work there again. Dishonest management and self-serving leadership. Self promotion and back stabbing seem to yield results. Suffocating environment, where managerial courage is promoted but god help you if you call something out. Ditched the annual Gartner Surveys when they were seen to be so far behind in their sector. Rated \"A+ by Moody;s says it all; forbes best companies running.  Excellent sales force training and administrative training for all personnel involved. I didn\\'t work in the main Springfield office, I just worked with one representative in his own office. I enjoyed it, he is a family friend. I worked flexible hours. Was not that great a job. All commission. They obviously just want to milk you for your markets and to sell to family then kick you to the curb in a revolving door of reps. Northwestern Mutual is a great insurer.  However, the local agency leadership was less than stellar to work with.  Not to go into much details, I did not enjoy working in that environment and dreaded going in every morning at 6:30 a.m. NM treats contract workers very poorly. You are reminded several times a day  that you are not an employee of the company even though contractors do most of the work. Great experience- just make sure you are willing to work hard and strongly believe in whole life- If you can do those 2 things, you will be successful Northwestern Mutual as a company is a strong, financially responsible company that for the most part takes care of their policy holders. The individual office and group that I worked in was quite different. They preached continuous improvement, but then shunned me when I informed them I was going to go back to school to finish my degree. The only people that really had it well off there were the ones that went through the internship program and committed everything they had at the sacrifice of having a family life. I didn\\'t want that. used off site systems to gather info.,enter data into onsite computer,spacious work area,ask anything and it shall be answered,answered/ made phone calls Workplace culture is non-competitive. Everyone willing to help. Friendly environment. Enjoyed my role immensely. Worked with little to no supervision but supervisor always available for questions. Hardest part of the job was managing FR expectations and tracking down paperwork for operations functions. Most enjoyable part of the job was the MP. Very friendly and takes care of his employee\\'s well-beings. The Hardest part of the job is once you get past your natural market to call on. Its hard to keep getting people to call, so if you are not good at prospecting and cold calling you wont be successful. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. I loved working for the company and loved what they stand for. It is hard to start out in the job though with kids as you may not make much income right away. If you are the breadwinner, make sure you have about 6 months of savings before jumping on the opportunity. Overall the job was not for me but I appreciated the opportunity and it was a wonderful learning experience. That being said I worked from7:30 am till after 5pm most days and was exhausted. I definitely would have gotten burned out if I had to do that all year The company was switching from traditional waterfall IT project management to some form of Agile, Scrum, KANBAN, or SAFe, but it was never clearly defined.  They tried making all teams fit into one category, which clearly wasn\\'t working. You are usually there early to make phone calls and then from there the rest of the day is filled with meetings. It is up to you to make meetings and find new clients. Their is little to no help getting them besides what you do. The company itself is an amazing place to work.  Most representatives are wonderful, kind people, but other representatives are sort of vague when training new hires and not too friendly. If you are scared of hard work and gathering a book of business, don\\'t work here.  If you want to be part of a national treasure that cares about the employees and does what they say every time, then come on board.  I left a six-figure income, salary, position to joint the NM team on a commission only structure.  It hasn\\'t been easy, in fact it has been very hard, but the most rewarding career I could hope for. Was a waste of a summer. Impossible to make money without high pressure sales of high commision rip-off life insurance policies to family and friends. Only benefit was learning about the industry and how they paid for us to get our licenses to sell insurance. It\\'s just selling life insurance to your friends/family. They try to make it look like its \"financial advising\" but its not at all. At least not the internship. Learned a lot about the financial and insurance industry.,Welcoming environment with staff willing to train you and transfer their knowledge to build the team. Company fosters building your business into a career. Many great benefits are there for Financial Representatives and the company is built around helping them. Many support positions lacked room for growth and lacked training. In recruiting I had more freedom and benefits than the office support staff, but nearly not as many as the reps. Northwestern is a great company to work for! You must make sure you meet the quota in order to keep your contract. They offer tons of training and support! My brief stint at NML was on the service desk.,My typical day at work was taking calls supporting financial analysts in the field who sell the product. I\\'d be expected to support everything from tv\\'s to phones to *insert device here* as the company\\'s motto is \"we don\\'t say no\". This not surprisingly creates more than a bit of tension and confustion regarding how to handle calls that come in. Add to that the reps that call in are less than helpful when trying to support their issues, and are more than happy to let you know this. These are just the main reasons why my stint there was brief. when I was there it became too stressful to work there.  They started micro managing employees and the old feel of Northwestern Mutual was gone.  Management gotten to the point if a person spoke out about something against the company or duties that was being perform daily it could land in you \"trouble\" LOVE my job but there is no room for growth. We restructured our team not long ago and what I was thought to believe was my career path no longer seems to be an option and conversations are not on the same path. The opportunity there is fantastic and the coaching is known to be the best in the industry but the reality is that it is a very hard job that requires long hours and while you can pretty easily make six figures and in some cases 7 figures you will need to consistently outwork those around you in order to succeed in this business. Fantastic place to work. Developed experience in dialing, prospecting, setting meetings, and helping clients achieve financial security. Experienced team members help guide interns to success and are there to help every step of the way Working at Northwestern is entirely what you make of it. The base salary is low but you have unlimited earning potential. Everyone was friendly but no real bonds or culture. Amazing work environment. Provides exemplary training in the financial field. Success in the career is what you make it. Potential to earn high income, but job is completely commission based. Advancement in the career depends completely on your work ethic, but there are opportunities available. Company culture is great. You get to work with awesome people who are very skilled in the profession. It was a great experience to work at Northwestern as an inter. Working with senior managers was the most helpful when trying to close deals. I found that the company had a great program for interns to learn first hand what the Advisor role had to offer. Honestly not the worst company to work for if insurance sales is for you. The people working at the office are nice enough but  at the same time the interns were under supported. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. This was an internship which was basically just trying to sell life insurance.  As a college student, approaching someone about life insurance was not going to work.  I think this internship could have been productive if it was more designed to shadow the senior reps, assist with paperwork and products, etc to gain the necessary experience.  Sending us out to try to do it on our own did not lead to success in my case.  Also only paid around $100/week I believe. My job was alright. Technically I did not work for Northwestern Mutual I worked for the man I was an assistant to. On my paychecks it said his name so I can\\'t fully say anything else Very competitive internship. Gained great networking and business experience. The branch in Wellesley MA is a great place to work, with great people and management. I learned alot as this was my first job out of college.,Was promoted to recruiter.  I was not willing to relocate so I sought other employment.,Made alot of great connections. Came in out of college as an intern and went full time. They have you start by looking at who you could sell to (friend and family) first then train you on how to get referrals.,I learned a ton and grew a lot because it was a hard job. I got a better understanding of financial planners and their everyday life. I learned a lot from the Sales School class that was taught to us by the intern director. I was an intern and it certainly felt like they used the interns to bring in business for the full time reps once we left, but it was a good learning experience and they internship managers helped me secure the job I have today. Great Internship for a new business professional. Working at NM will give you a lot of experience in life and in finance.  They spend a lot of time and resources providing their new advisors with training so that they will be prepared to run client meetings on their own.  Not one complaint.  The most difficult part is the 100% commission, however, that is not a concern when you have your book of business built. If you like hounding people and begging them to buy life insurance then this is the job for you. I came from a large bank doing investments, they promise you that you can sell funds, stocks, etc...yet once you start all they do is hound you on trying to get your customer to buy whole life instead of investments. Steer clear! The company culture is terrible, it is like the wild wild west when it comes to colleagues stealing clients from you. They lie to you about the job to get you in there. There is no synergy and they don\\'t care whether you leave or stay. Once you leave they try to ruin you and your life. They do a good job of that. They put pressure on you because they can. I would never recommend working there. The Internship was an overall great experience. Great Culture, Learned a lot, but was not compensated for the amount of work put in. I feel that everyone should do something like this to really see the pros and cons of the financial services industry. It is currently a challenging environment, due to constant restructuring, but I am hopeful it will get better.  The culture is very political, and people are fearful for their jobs.,With every restructuring, the new management has to take months to make directional decisions, and the lost productivity is frustrating.,That said, there are really great people who work here and that makes each day enjoyable.  I am optimistic for the future. It was frustrating to work in this role. I was with the company for over a year to see it out. Unfortunately, I\\'m on the other end of things feeling like it was a waste of a year. This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for and I would still be working there if it wasn\\'t for my own weaknesses.  They have a great support system and the products are the best in the industry.  You can see for yourself by the third party ratings. I enjoyed my time at Northwestern Mutual.  I learned a lot about insurance, the insurance marketplace and how to develop a business.  Overall, I would recommend. Hard and stressful work, only go for a position here if you are able and WANTING to work like a dog and effectively employ any underhanded tactic to getting into meetings with people. ,The payoff is incredible but if you are not connected to the finish line it is not worth it.,Also, nobody will respect what you do because of the previously mentioned underhanded tactics until you survive the start of your practice and are then wealthy and successful Enjoyed this position for the learning aspect.  Learned a good deal about finances from this position.  The only issue is that you can run out of leads quick if you\\'re not aggressive enough.  It\\'s tough to stick with it for the first couple months but after that, things start to get better if you apply yourself. Fast paced environment with attention to detail,Responsible for educating Field Representatives and assistants in a positive and upbeat manner,Must be an advocate for all phone calls received Save 6 months of living expences before you start this career. Training was great but getting the ball rolling is hard to start.  If you do not have support or other income don\\'t waist your time. Tough learning curve in the beginning. However if you come from a high socio-economic status and possess many connections of high net worth individuals you can make a VERY large amount of money. It is possible to do well without a good socio-economic status, it just makes the learning curve even steeper. It is a role suited for those who enjoy working with people and have very strong interpersonal skills. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. There were many inconsistencies between what they told you and what was true. This was a sales job through and through, and as hard as I tried to do what was absolutely right for the client I was always pressured to make a sale. Good lessons learned even if they were bad ones. If you are looking for an internship or job that will give you autonomy and the ability to positively impact the lives of others, than this is the right job for you. There no wonder why Northwestern Mutual has been amongst the top 5 internship programs for years. Thanks to this opportunity I learn how to work a double screen, answer multi-phone lines among other things. I really liked this job and the way it run. Go to mandatory meetings with leadership on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. After the mandatory meetings you\\'re on your own to find people to meet with, help with financially and procure sales. Repeat. Working for Northwestern was an experience unparalleled to most career experiences. Every day I was challenged and forced to grow outside my comfort zone. I received top-notch education and was encouraged to think freely and creatively in order to achieve my goals. However I believe that northwestern mutual would do much better with solving their high turnover a problem if they were able to support their advisers to survive with in the first five years. The environment was immediately very welcoming, and I did not at all feel like the was any aggressive competition. If anything the competition helped the productivity of the workers. The office was in a good area so there was much to do when on said break Great Management and training. The basic aspect of the job is to set as many meetings as possible and conduct business through insurance and investment portfolios. Fantastic company, but an inadequate compensation package consisting of 100 percent commission-based-pay. Very high turnover and no continuity amongst office. NM is a great company to work for.  The give you the freedom to to build your business the way you want to, while doing it the right way!  It is a grind in the beginning, and you have to be willing to fight and work for what you want.  Its not for everyone, but Dior the right person its a great opportunity! Very independent work style. Everyone is on their own although there are very strict guidelines you have to meet. Most days consist of meeting with a few people and putting together plans. My role currently includes all of the typical life insurance underwriting tools and processes I am accustom to utilizing however I also find I spend a lot of time during my day doing non underwriting or clerical duties of which I find no personal job satisfaction in.,I would prefer to focus strictly on decision making and leave clerical duties to those that are more suited in that arena. Always have someone to lean on when you can’t figure something out. Good support staff for when things are not so great.  The only thing I wish was available,Would be a salary/commission pay structure. Tough to change to this career. If you aren\\'t looking to actually sell insurance, don\\'t work here! They do not care about you as an employee, management is strict, and will hound you to SELL insurance and that\\'s it. They do not care about your well-being , family, or future. All they care about is their numbers. Everyone who works there is selfish and only cares about themselves. If you\\'re a friendly individual, don\\'t come here, this place can turn you bitter. All about who you know. Sales process is long an challenging but if you are willing to go through with it you will  see returns. Management depends on the office. I unfortunately had a poor experience with mine. Quick paced, quick turn around for things, but overall it was a good experience to learn the ins and outs of the insurance and financial industry. As an administrative assistant it teaches you to prioritize and really be organized I enjoyed working at NM. However, the communication between management and HR was poor. They also have a very high turnover rate with employees. You have no job security and they lay people off every year. Overall, I liked working there but didn’t know until later that they let people go all the time. Working under a large corporate umbrella like NWM is great - but you also get the benefit of working for an independent agent as your direct supervisor/boss. They need to have a better set up plan for new hires. Being Sales, the training for 1 month is not long enough to help get new advisors on their feet. However, they give you the best tools to succeed. I just wished they had a training program for 1 year of job security to really get people started Training was great but basically, they are looking for you to call close friends and family for business. The office I worked at let the interns come as they please did not promote personal growth well. My management and training was a bit lacking due to the changes the company was experiencing.  Overall great group of people, strong ethics and company to work for. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. A typical day at work involves calling 25-40 prospective clients to set meetings with them, attending a few all office meetings as well as any client meetings you have set for that day. The worst part of the job is getting references, you basically milk your friends and family for every contact that they know because it\\'s against company policy to contact people you haven\\'t been referred to. Your goal as a financial rep for a great insurance company is to save families when the worst happens. So from an ethics standpoint, the hundreds of people you bother with never ending phone calls are recompensed by the children who get to go to college because of you. Despite the good that you get the chance to do, an overwhelming majority of people will believe that you are a scam artist. In the operations department at Nmis, I opened and managed client accounts, deposited checks, and managed account alerts, while addressing important emails...Kept an excel spreadsheet on daily reminder for client issues I am working on and resolved. Kept client notes for manager as a reference on issues being worked on. Great focus on health and wellness. Continuing to focus on new strategy and how to best align culture of a start up and 160+ year old organization to best serve their clients now and in the future. Not only is this the premiere insurance company in the country to purchase as a customer, It is the best place to work. people are caring about their customer and fellow employees. 100% commission job. This industry in general is a good starting point for your career, but it really highly depends on the network you have or are able to build. Get your certifications and get out Great company with a long track record of success. In order to thrive in this position you must have very low overhead and low salary expectations to begin with but can be very rewarding if you stick it out and make a career out of it. This job was a perfect entry into the corporate world, though not in my area of interest. Personal finance and life insurance is a specific field for a sepcific type of person. Culture- great,Management- great,Co-workers- great,Compensation- you eat what you kill i.e. if you don\\'t close you make $0,Just understand that you need to have a solid 6 months-1 year worth of savings on hand before you go for it, it takes time get you client base to a point where you can actually start doing decent. No knocks on anything else, honestly was an awesome place to be with top notch pros and world-class training programs/resources. It has been a phenomenal working environment as a financial advisor for Northwestern Mutual. It was one of the biggest learning experiences I have ever had. As part of the agreement to my severence package, I am not allowed to comment on or say anything negative about the company.  That being said, the need for them to have such a clause in their agreement speakes for itself. Low risk business startup. Perfect balance of challenge and support. Amazing rewards and coaching. Managing Partner is open minded and support team is helpful and encouraging. There\\'s literally no difference between what you and a veteran financial advisor would do. If you have a network of people you trust. You can\\'t lose with this company. Northwestern Mutual has a great work environment and allows you build upon your entrepreneurship skills with their internship program by putting you in charge of your own financial advising business. Hardest part of the job is work/home life balance. The most enjoyable part is working with the clients and providing long term solutions for their retirement.  I enjoy the long term relationships that evolve. This company was a great company to work for, great benefits, great pay, great  management. Flexible, dependable, reliable, respectable, work life balance The Managing Partner treated employees dismissively and with contempt. He also unlawfully took a larger commission without written authorization. The Company was made aware of the issue but  choose to ignore the ongoing issues. The company does have great product and planning tools.  They also have a great customer service in the home office.  The big problem is the structure of management which creates an atmosphere that forgets about the advisors. Learned how to manage my time and work with clients one-on-one. The most enjoyable part of the day was working with other advisors and learning tips to help me in the future. dont really remember had this internship 10 years ago. they paid for my life license. Dont have anything else to tell. Only worked there 2 day out of the week for 4 hours. Generally, depending on which area of the company you work in your either love or loathe your job.  They emphasize the customer experience but do not focus on the areas where this truly matters.  Very cut throat, too many consultants that do not know the customers, the work, etc.   I would not recommend this if you work in any operations role. They massively underpay staff. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Typical day was calling 40 friends/family, getting 4 referrals and making one face-to-face appointment. Without experience in personal finance, it was a challenge (almost awkward) to convince friends, family and their referrals I was qualified to conduct financial services for them. If you have experience/confidence to do this, then I would highly recommend Northwestern Mutual for the commission rates on life insurance premiums. They have excellent support and knowledge of finacial services and will push you to grow in this field. I feel it was not the right time for me to join this company, within a year of graduating college. Competitive environment with a desire to be the best, by all employees. The reason I left the internship was because I am on the college golf team and could not dedicate as much time as was needed in order to be successful at both. An average company to work for with solid benefits. Difficult company to grow and advance. Very stressful work environment and will not reward employees that go above and beyond normal job responsibilities. This is a great place to learn the business acumen needed to run a financial adviser\\'s office.  I was fortunate to have the opportunities to further advance my skills and education in the area of financial services by enrolling in the tuition reimbursement program. Had a bad experience with by employers. They treated me badly and didnt care to listen to anything I had to say. I wasnt treated equally when it came to my colleagues. Well, even though it was demanding and stressful; they did a great job of communicating, honoring, and appreciating their employees while building teams. You enter the role as a \"Financial Adviser\" only to realize you are slinging insurance to your family and friends. The job is what you make of it but the culture pushes insurance over actual advising. My experience there was great. Good people who appear to work hard.,The person who hired me gave me an opportunity to network and gain necessary business experience. Ever since the \"re-invention\" (the dismissal of hundreds of employees and many early forced retirements) that happened last year, the culture at NM has changed, in my opinion to the worst.   The environment has become very cut throat and everyone is worried about themselves, not the team itself.  I have also seen micro management be more prevalent recently. This was a part time job for an agent who was about to retire.  Most of the time it was just me in the office and my responsibilities were minimal.  There was no office interaction and it was a very boring job. There is a lot of change going on in the organization right now. This can be a good thing if it is managed appropriately......again, if it is managed appropriately. One of the worst places I\\'ve ever worked.  Managing Directors only care about them getting paid.  They fake care about charity as more of a promotional tool.  Commission only with products that everyone either already has or nobody wants. The job is not for everybody some people love it and can succeed in the environment but it is definitely not for everyone. Must be willing to talk to people and be able to sell yourself without much experience in the field. Great place to work with high level of flexibility and independence. Hours can be long but are rewarding. Great opportunity to switch careers and begin a new role! NWM was a great place to gain experience. the people and other staff were nice and helpful. however, because you are mostly paid by your advisor, your compensation depends on what how well they do, and what they can afford to pay. It is a great company with a longstanding track record.  It is geared for the driven.  Great culture, and opportunity for growth both personally and professionally. I learned a lot about myself, who I am, what I\\'m capable of, my strong suits, confirmations of my values both personally and professionally and how I will always know I will excel in what I do by doing what is right and in the best interest of my client and/or company I am working with. Northwestern Mutual/ my team (which was different than the office and experience) challenged my limits, and made me set goals daily, weekly and monthly and held me accountable in a way that helped me grow. I wish Northwestern Mutual Greater Tampa Bay offices were set up differently and managed differently because I do believe there would be a lot more success for all the offices otherwise. Overall, a fantastic place to work! Amazing product line, a staff of high moral integrity in nearly all offices. A feeling of comfort when it comes to the idea that these individual will be holding themselves to the highest standards when it come to managing clients assets and designs for true comprehensive financial planning. Great team atmosphere and culture,Opportunities for great impact, income, and independence.,Mutual company (owned by the clients),Strong history of serving. (Over 160 years!),Company pays for you to get designations (CFP, CLU, ChFC, etc) misguided initiatives, lack of quality leadership, extremely poor technology platform and case management system, high quality field advisers that are not serviced to the level that they and their clients deserve. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. The overall aura of Northwestern Mutual is spectacularly rewarding and allowed me work flexibly with my clients and colleagues to promote great products. nice culture, everyone wants you to succeed. Staff offers lots of advice and is very professional about everything! As a documentation specialist I was able to intern and balance both school and work since they are understanding that I am a college student. I did not enjoy my time at NWM. The PR manager did not know anything about her job and left me confused. But I have heard great things about the finance internship. Competitive culture. Comprehensive benefits package not offered. Always on the clock. Work life balance is hard. The people in general are great. There is not career advancement unless you want to get into sales. Best part of the job is hearing people\\'s stories,I have grown a-lot in this role personally and professionally.,The hardest part of the job is the rejection you face, very tough to find  the right candidate, high turnover.,A typical day includes phoning to set meetings, conducting interviews, guiding candidates through selection process, meetings with financial advisors for prospecting, Meeting everyday. Must call people everyday. Bring in clients to review finances. Must pass state insurance tests to perform in internship. Only paid $100 a week plus commission. They hire  group of people for their yearly campaigns and then fire almost everyone in group they hired. Managers are horrible don\\'t ask questions because you will be fired Great way to get to use to meeting people. ,hard to to financial and insurance products when you are 20 years old.,learned more about financial products and compound interests I loved the people I worked with and made some good friends. The workload varied from heavy to at times slow. I had to quit because of the commute and my need to pursue another career. Learn a lot and work with some great people. Flexible hours and you get compensated for the amount of work and effort that you put in. For people that aren\\'t afraid to make cold calls. I really learned alot about the insurance industry working with NM.  I made great friends there that really made it a fun place to work. The management was laid back, and very easy and flexible to work with This was my first internship while in college. It was a great intro to sales and client management. The leadership team was amazing and always so patient with the interns. They were a great example and let us shadow them while visiting their clients.,We were selling plans and contacting referrals, which is tough in the beginning but all a part of sales. However, the team provided extensive support and trainings to help us become successful in the role. The environment at nwm was very hostile.  Management was too busy gossiping to even help with a concern. The facility is gorgeous, the personalities of the employees were not so much. It was a long walk to my desk, especially in the winter. They provide lunch to employees, which is nice, but you only get 35 minutes, so that leaves little option if you need to run an errand, being that it takes 10 minutes to get to your car. It was okay. I was a member of the summer internship program. I obtained my Life Accident and Health FINRA certification prior to employment. Was not the best workplace for me. Processing calls,taking payments,life insurance applications,pensions,sales presentations,making appointments,filing,typing,record keeping,accounts payable,accounts receivable,payroll Very collaborative and conducive for excellent work. Great work environment and culture full of great people and helpful working staff. Would recommend. Northwestern Mutual has been around for awhile and their college financial representative internship is rated one of the tops in the country.,It requires you to build a book of business by calling friends, family, past coworkers, etc. ,This can be difficult because most are not going to buy from an intern who are gone after 3 months. That\\'s where actual associates come in, who go in with you on prospective clients. They can be helpful, but in the end I think their main goal is to get the client rather than help the college financial rep learn.,I did like the experienced I gained communicating with strangers, but it was certainly frustrating getting rejected so many times. I was an intern in a branch office. Good sales experience and was able to get 0215 - Life Insurance Certification. However, as an intern I felt pressured to sell to my friends and family which I did not like. Just a short internship but I enjoyed the experience. Very corporate environment, but lovely people to work with. I learned a lot about investment data. Excellent place to work. Generally you\\'re working for an individual sales rep. It\\'s nice to work for a small business with the atmosphere of big business. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. I spend the first three hours telephone marketing and spending time soliciting in the local communities. I worked with Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance company approving prospects. Internship was fair and honest. I was offered a full time position but did not pursue a career with the firm due to compensation and lack of any type of guaranteed income. I worked with the the executive manager and the new representatives coming in. I taught them the paperwork and the proprietary software. Northwestern Mutual does not offer any compensation to new representatives. It is a commission only job which makes it difficult to recruit. They like to pretend and state that they\\'re different but the reality is that they are like any other carrier except that the only difference is an exclusive distribution channel meaning you can only be appointed to them to sell their product,,,no broker channels If you enjoy networking and helping people in a meaningful way then this job is for you! You will get to meet and touch many different lives. As well as work alongside other intelligent minds in a fast pace sales environment. I worked at Northwestern Mutual for about a year as a financial representative. Like any other commission based job, they bring you in and pump you up, then set you loose. The whole thing felt eerily like a pyramid scheme with down lines and all. If anyone decides they want to get rid of their coverage even after you leave, you have to pay the company back. I would never recommend this type of job to anyone I know. Horrible experience. I am a full cycle recruiter prior to joining, they were looking for warm bodies for financial service reps to sell to their friends and families.,Was told I would be in the 100,000k+. Promised something that didn\\'t happen. Manager never there. The products of Northwestern are fabulous other managers are great. Northwestern teaches strong ethics and has a strong training program. Advancement fast with licenses. Leads are hard to get, but product is excellent. They make you cold call friends and famiyl to buy life insurance, no teaching about anything else. The only number that mattered was the number of dials made per day/week. I had a great experience at Northwestern but I just realized insurance was not what I wanted to do. The work place and leaders in the building are there to help you succeed. I was a summer intern and it was a great look into the competitive market of financial planning. It is a very competitive market that allows you to work as much or as little as you want. The more people you know the better, because they are your clients. The culture is like no other. Very motivating and able to be compensated very well. Northwestern Mutual is a great place to gain sales experience though the internship program. As an intern you make phone calls, attend meetings, and network to grow a client base. You also get to make your own hours, which is pretty sweet. Working for Northwestern Mutual was very educational. I learned a lot about the insurance and investment industry. You need to be very detailed to be able to work there. Lisa Tran was a joy to work with. You make as much as you sell.  Strictly based on getting clients/selling insurance.  There can be high potential but it\\'s stressful to get your own clients The internship mines interns for their potential contacts. Wanted to push a product that was more for employee\\'s benefit than client\\'s. Didn\\'t feel like they truly valued the interns\\' experience. Poor management. Sell you on free food, which is not good. Poor culture. Do not keep up with the expectations they speak of. Limited knowledge learned on the job. It is a lot of hard work but the longer you are there the less work it becomes. The people are the best part of working here. I enjoy coming to work with my co-workers. I worked in a dish room with 4 people and we took care of over 2,000 employee lunches in a 2 hour period.  It was very hard on the physical end.  I wanted to move up but there was not a chance for advancement. The work is time consuming, but very rewarding.  Everyone was very supportive and wanted to help push you.  Overall,  Working at NM was a great experience. The Dallas office is friendly and helpful.  ,The home office gives support and training.,Licensed individuals may receive classroom continuing education free of charge. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Great co-workers and wonderful workplace culture. Hardest part of the job was doing the same tasks every day. The management was great - I never felt micromanaged. Fun place to work at. You can make as much many as you want but you have to know people and work hard to grow your network. Insurance is one of the hardest things to sell but if youre good at it then you can make a boatload of money. •\\tProvided expert guidance and solutions to meet client financial goals and objectives at every life stage. ,•\\tExecuted a sales process with prospective and existing clients, which included: Prospecting, Telephoning, Approach, Fact-finding, Closing and Follow Through. ,•\\tIn addition to the sales process, I analyzed client personal financial goals and created a written analysis. In conjunction with the analysis, I provided specific recommendations as to which products would appropriately suit their expressed needs within their budgetary constraints. many aspects of the career seem out of your control. the schedule is flexible and management is amazing. everyone has a genuine desire to see you succeed. Excellent company to work for or to be a client of. Culture is second to none. Honest and trustworthy are required traits. Incredible job training and continued management. Great company for career growth and success. If leaders at NM would get together and go in the same direction, this company could be world class. But every VP and some directors are into \"empire building\" and only worry about their particular silo. Ask good questions in your interviews, and take great notes. Typical day included trying to procure hot leads by any means necessary. This procurement involves using friends, family, and past coworkers to find individuals who may or may not need your services or could be willing to point you in the direction of someone else who may or may not need your services. It is basically cold-calling within your social network. Management treats it as fine (of course) because they profit off of you trying to sell these policies. Other employees were cool and the training was in depth however. I learned quite a bit about future planning as well as the need for retirement plans and options that are available to people from all walks of life. Call on potential clients to set meeting.,Attend set meetings with clients to find goals.,Create personalized plan for each client according to goals. ,Make sure client is happy with plan and implement plan. Was a great internship and learning experience to begin learning the financial services industry.  The training program was fantastic when it came to phone calls and sitting down in meetings.  The other representatives were very helpful when I had questions and they were always willing to help the customer.  The hardest part of the job was balancing the training, working, and getting used to the business world.  While the most enjoyable part was the amazing culture of the people in the office, managers, and other representatives while also learning a lot in my first real work experience. Northtwestern Mutual was a good and fun place to work. I was there for just about 12 years and the culture was such that it was both challenging and good natured at the same time. The training and mentorship program that comes with this job is beyond great! You learn a lot on how to maintain a schedule and work with others. Also it is an opportunity to push has person into a leader. It is a go and get it position as you have to seek out clients on your own. You learn on to deal with the rejection but also build great relationships with your clients. I would recommend this job to anyone in their hometown. Otherwise it is a VERY difficult industry to get a foot in the door. Underpaid to start but can become very successful with a lot of hard work and dedication.  Work/Home balance is difficult. At NM in Dallas you will undoubtedly have a strong support system through training and one on one development. You will also have access to the premier products and services in the industry. It\\'s a difficult role.  B2C was not for me, but it is a great position for someone who can, financially, afford to invest about one year of time in order to create a large client base. The environment is fast paced and it is a role in which having a very strong network helps. The position was a sales role and it was a very competitive environment, in a positive way. I worked here over 10 years ago, and from what I remember, there was a lot of criticism from the agent I worked for.  She didn\\'t allow much independence or value employee ideas.  The agent was in and out of the office and was very micro-managing, calling constantly or looking over my shoulder when I was working.  It made for a very uncomfortable work environment. It\\'s always busy at working at this company. I learned to work with a diverse professional insurance agent. I learned how to prioritized request accordingly. The management team is excellent. The hardest part of the job is time. Every second of your time counts. Mutual fund applications and checks must be processed in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to work with insurance agents in a different professional backgrounds. Commission based sales executive in the field of Financial Management is not for everyone. It provides a great way of stepping out of one\\'s comfort zone, and the firm does an excellent job of providing all the training one needs. But your success is entirely up to you, which works for some and not for others. The workplace culture is excellent-it is built around collaborative camaraderie, with a dash of competitiveness. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients manage their finances in a way that benefited them over the long-term. The least enjoyable part of the job was finding those clients. NM is a nice company to work for. However, for certain areas it\\'s hard to move around into other departments and advance your career. It\\'s a very competitive company. My views are private and confidential as is required by my licensing. As most people in the industry know Northwestern is a conservative and trusted company. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. It was a great place to work were you had lots of help in your development as an advisor. You get great experience learning how to run your own business and what it is like to obtain your own clients. Entrepreneurial opportunity, but don\\'t be fooled into thinking this is self-employment.  Selling insurance is a must.  It is a good opportunity for the right individual, but it is not for everyone. The hardest part of the job is sitting all day. ,The most enjoyable is TEAM work.,Love the Casual, Dress for your day approach!,Management is great. So are the leads I work with. The biggest item learned in a career at Northwestern Mutual is human nature.  You will know what people are going to do/say before it ever comes out of their mouth.  ,Also, the training and development is second to nobody.  And there is a fully funded pension along with many other exceptional bonuses and benefits. Be ready to absorb 6 months to a year of financial strain as it is a commission position. A lot of time will be spent on the phone setting meetings and reaching out to potential clients. Much more of a sales role than a financial one when first starting out in the company. You\\'ll be dealing with mostly insurance and joint work to begin with. The work is interesting. Commission only compensation makes it difficult. Must be comfortable calling a lot of people to try and set enough appointments to survive. Going in, the management team makes the job seem very pretty, fun and rewarding.  Then you are hit with a harsh reality that you make no money, you have to scrape, claw and grind to make little money.  The training is good but not where it should be.  You are required to build a financial planning practice from the ground up and you dont get enough time to be able to fully get it up and running once you get the hang of it without possible termination looming in front of you. I\\'ll always be a client, just not an employee.  If a Salary + commission was offered, this career would be AMAZING.  hard to get started without a large existing market.  However, if you put in the work, and luck is in your favor, the career here is amazing.,The hardest part is the long hours and low pay.  If you can get past that the first few years, you will be fine. Northwestern Mutual is the best company to work for if you want to have opportunities for growth, and if you want to really make a lot of money. You have to be hardworking and it is best if you know a lot of people in the area. It is the best place to pursue a career in financial planning. Northwestern Mutual is a great opportunity for individuals who have an entrepreneurial desire to create financial plans for clients. The representative has the ability to build the practice they desire. Northwestern Mutual is your typical fortune 500 company. I learned the investment industry and overall business management. ,Workplace culture is very much so the Northwestern Mutual way. Business is to use your friends and contacts to join the organization. Very uncomfortable, awkward work environment. Poor leadership. 100% commission based only. I don\\'t feel inclined to write a review on this job since it wasn\\'t really a job. It was more of a call center designed to funnel clients into the main advisor in the office. Hard to make a career in it. Great skill builder in sales but wouldn\\'t advise it as a career unless you are well connected in your area. Great management..they really care about you and your success. The workplace culture is acceptable to some and overwhelming to others. A dedicated, goal setting individual would do well in this company. Being a yes man or woman will also work well for you. Northwestern Mutual is one of the greatest companies I\\'ve been able to work with. They are fair and business focused with every adviser, and really try to take care of you. Hours are long, especially in the early years. Learned alot of running your own business and time management. You \"on your own business\" but have different required development meetings throughout the week. If you already know you want to be a financial advisor this is the job for you. If not, you are basically bringing in your family members to try and sell them insurance. I loved working with all the people, the management understood family and work life balance. the hardest part of my job was delivering bad renewals, however , resolving the bad renewal with creative ways of switching up the benefits to make the renewal more cost effective for the employer and the employee was the most enjoyable part of my job. There was a great opportunity to learn as well as to advance to a insurance agent.,I however did not want to be in insurance on a full time basis.,My boss as well as his assistant were great individuals as well as eager to teach me many things. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. No salary 100% commission. Very non-technical job. Same conversations day in and day out. Hard to have an effective network to sell to if you are young. Northwestern Mutual is a great company. You pretty much run your own business and work as much or as little as you want as long as you are producing. In the beginning it requires a ton of hard work, but once you get in a grove and know what you are doing your business can run itself. A lot of the people who have been there a while are great at what they do. It is stressful in the beginning but if you\\'re successful it is a really rewarding job. Typically, in this field, you would get up early to get your daily schedule set, and ready to go.  You might analyze the market and see how it\\'s doing.  Then you would dial clients, and potential clients.  Within the day you would set meetings with people and talk about their financial futures. Great place to work. My idea work atmosphere. The people are nice and very well put together. If you love working in the traditional cubical, saying hello to your neighbors type of job. This is it! Decent place to begin a career. I wouldn\\'t recommend this as a long term financial planning career. The internship was great, but the full time opportunity was disappointing. Must be interested in Finances and love sales. If you want an opportunity to create your own schedule and income this can be a great opportunity as long as you have the time and flexibility to build your own book of business. NM offered me many different paths of productive growth and opportunities to contribute on many different teams.Working here provided me many opportunities to perform at my peak. My typical day working at Northwestern Mutual was to cold call potential clients and sell them life, health or accident insurance. Once a week there was a required training session for interns where we were focused on how to expand client lists and be a better financial adviser. Although there was unlimited income potential at Northwestern Mutual, a $0 salary made it a tough career to transition into. Building trust with potential clients to manage their money takes time and until then, there is no pay. Constantly calling and prospecting.,100% commission.,Managers are really cool.,Great training program but when you go into it full time you change everything up.,Great culture around the office. Very professional business environment. It really prepares you for life in the business world and what it\\'s like to be a young professional. I really enjoyed the people and how supportive everyone was. Northwestern given you the tools and opportunities for you to help develop skills in areas of financial planning and networking.,There are a bunch of great people in the office that are willing to help. Outstanding ideas at work campaign that provides public speaking growth. suggestion, collaboration, improvement suggestions, testing, implementing improvements.,Top-notch training tools tools and available programs.,Great culture with the promotion of diverse views. You have a lot of freedom with this career, its not easy what so ever. Its not for everybody but they teach you a lot. It\\'s just not for me. I like getting instant gratification if I\\'m working. This job requires years of patience. great company i really enjoyed working there. i can make my own hours, and work when i want to work. lots of resources were there to help me succeed in the field Great place to work, but not for longer than 1 year. The environment, culture and people are great, but the compensation and benefits are so low. It is hard to sustain. The culture of the office was great!  The insurance sales world is run by over-paid, unqualified sales men with competitive sales goals.  This leads to underpaid help and a lack of transparency with clients.  I am glad to have learned the importance of financial planning and relieved to be out of that position. NM is a wonderful company to work for. They always put the client first, which is seemingly unnatural in the insurance world. They care (at least in our agency) about personal growth and development, as well as the professional growth. Company changing development philosophy, change in scrum master.  Too tied to Agile philosophy, need more ability to fit what works for the team.  Too many meetings about meetings. I was a college student and learned a lot about sales which I did not want to pursue but is a great skill to have! No matter what you will have to learn how to sell in life. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Management hired a lot of interns and essentially threw us at a wall to see who would stick. Not much help, tough business to crack in to anyway. Rewarded well if you \"work hard\" or have a preexisting client base, or one big anchor client. All about selling life insurance as much and as often as possible. Quality has rapidly declined at Northwestern Mutual.  In the company\\'s effort to make the clients their primary focus, they have completely neglected their employees and the poor work culture that many employees hush about, yet management refuses to discuss head on.  ,I worked in a call center environment that used to be very accommodating to employees, but that has gone away in recent years.  You are allowed 29 minutes off the phones per day to get a snack, use the restroom, etc.  But if you take unscheduled time to work a particular case during downtime or have a meeting, that time is taken away from the 29 minutes you can use away from your desk because you are not considered to be \"working.\"  Because everybody taking calls is subject to the same types of stressful calls and an increasing use of temporary workers, this has created a very negative culture in the call center. Management is very rarely helpful or supportive.  Overall a very stressful and thankless job. Most positions have or are being outsourced to India.,Due to so much knowledge being outsourced and cost cutting measures this is not the place it used to be. Absolute excellent place to establish proper work ethics.  The mentor program is one that rivals many and has still made an impact to this day. Great workplace I took this job as a summer internship.  I thought that I would be making calls with hot and cold leads and selling insurance to individuals and businesses.  However, their model relies heavily on utilizing your own contacts to sell insurance to family and friends.  It is a good job if you don\\'t mind asking your friends and family to give you money, but can be awkward otherwise. Everyone is very friendly and helpful around the office. This workspace is more about what you make of your time at the office. You are in control of how much you want to work and earn. Great way to get going in a financial planning industry. Culture is amazing! Very hard to get going if you are not used to prospecting and managing a work/life balance. I  really enjoyed the Northwestern culture while I was working there. I learned a lot about financial planning and how the industry is run through the eyes of an advisor. I would not recommend working there directly out of college if you have no experience in the industry and lack a middle age market. A typical day was arranging all meetings and office conference calls. returning clients calls and assisting  with all correspondence. learned to follow up on all corresponded for agents and clients, management could be at times difficult but fair, the workplace was pleasant, hardest part of the job was making sure all details were checked and rechecked for accuracy to ensure all management and clients were satisfied. Enjoyed learning from  all agents and assistants in the company Really enjoyed working as an administrative assistant. The home office is very friendly and helpful with everything. Since agents are 1099 assistants don\\'t get many benefits. Typical work day consisted of assisting Life Insurance agents with all aspects of their business, assisting clients over the phone and in the office. Also helped with College internship program helping with interviews, hiring and teaching them the business process.  I received a vast knowledge of the insurance industry.  Great personal satisfaction assisting clients with all their needs. Manager was taking money out of my commissions. He was later fired for it. I don\\'t like to bad mouth a man who gave me my start. But as a rule, greed will kill a working relationship.. Rated top 5 internships in the nation. As an intern you have hands on experience as a financial Representative at the company, selling insurance. Hard work, good start. Unbelievable work experience. It was an incredible place to work, with amazing people alongside of me. They were very motivational and helpful all of the time. I have loved my time at KFG. The office culture is a wonderful atmosphere to work in and I will miss my team greatly. I am only changing jobs because I am getting married/relocating. This is one of the hardest sales jobs. 5% chance to make it to 5 years. If you put in the work, have the right clientele, and constantly improve; you can make it. In the role you maintain your own financial advisory practice with a need to generate your own clientele. The states life insurance exam is reimbursed. Use lots of interns to get their families and friends to sign up, don\\'t pay you other than a stipend that wont even cover parking/gas. Expect you to call family and friends and pressure them into buying insurance and stuff. This was an internship consisting of cold calling potential clients to sell insurance products. They utilize your personal contacts as leads and try to gain referrals from them. Training was detailed. Management was open to helping at anytime. They provided a great atmosphere. The hardest part was relying on 100% commission and waiting for those checks to come in. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. You earn what you pay because most of the bonus is linked to the commission. If you work hard, you can get a really good paid. I like the job because my manager is super nice. Good luck, they will make you call your entire contact list and anyone you know to try and sell them on the insurance. It is a good gig if you are good at sales, but tough to get started. This internship was describe in a way that was not reality. I was faced with many challenges and did not like working in corporate America.  It was bad Great for those who have extensive networks (family, friends, community) who can then turn that network into a profitable client base. Don\\'t join unless you can bring in your own clients. Great possibility for making large amounts of money, but at the cost of having the possibility of making little money. There is a great work culture but at the cost of having constant stress if you will have a paycheck. -Poor management,-Slow-paced,-Poeple are nice but not everyone is motivated,-Learned a lot as an intern,-Overall workplace culture seemed cliquey ,-Mentorship wasn\\'t very strong Great internship opportunities, and a great job to have if you are well connected to people that have money and are responsible with spending it and saving for retirement. I had a temporary position but enjoyed it very much. Learned a lot regarding the insurance industry. Co workers were great and very helpful.  I would recommend this office highly. Everyone there is fake. They pretend they care about you but they couldn\\'t care less. Only want to help you if it makes them money. Not a good place to start for a new career or someone who\\'s directly out of school. Barely got any experience, very discouraging if this is your career choice. Great mentors and interactive team members to make sure office runs smoothly. Great use of technology to stay organized and connected with other offices I worked for over a year for a financial representative at Northwestern Mutual. Everything about the job was fair and I enjoyed the work. Management was supportive and helped me learn the skills I needed to succeed. The culture was very friendly and inviting. The hardest part of my job was that it was difficult for me to advance without becoming a financial representative myself. Since I didn\\'t want to take the risk of a commission-only job, I felt stuck in my advancement and so I decided to move on after I finished my college degree. This agency that I worked at provided a great amount of sales training and helped prepare you for the world of prospecting. However, this is a very competitive industry and you have to be able to prospect to keep your business alive. I was told I would be analyzing people financials to find them appropriate policies to straighten out their financial plan. I was aware that the position involved some names, however, the position is completely sales and they did all the analyzing for you. I was ensured that if i stuck it out they would support me and refer on to getting a job at corporate, which was my goal from day one. Instead, they barred me from being able to do so. high energy,highly professional ,learned to better time manage through preparation and planning ,tools and resources readily available to learn and improve in job responsibilities I enjoyed my time there. It is a great office environmental. The people are very professional and helpful. I highly recommend working for Northwestern Mutual. Takes GRIT. ,Commission only. ,Hard work pays here. The ticket to a Seven Figure income for the one who is able to grind it out through to the top. ,Awesome company. Interesting work, a company that promotes from within, nice coworkers, good wellness and benefits, convenient location.Opportunity to learn about the company and who they help, High ups listen to employees ideas and potentially implement those ideas. Great place to work with great people, typical day involved acquiring clients and setting meetings. ,Culture and management was great,hardest part of the job is creating your own business,the most enjoyable part of the job is creating your own business. Was a high demanding, stressful experience.  Sales on commission position that encouraged you to use all your personal connections to recruit people to the company.  There are some good people and some bad people that work there.  A lot of gossip and favoritism.  The amount of pressure is out of control.  I would not recommend anyone going to this company.  Also, the turnover is huge.  About 5% of the people I knew from my time there are still there.  The people that recruited me and helped my career have also moved on. If you are a financially licensed and you think of leaving for Northwestern it is career suicide.,Great firm reputation. Impossible to make sustainable money.,Hidden licensing fees and \"mandatory\" training draining more funds. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Northwestern Mutual was a strong company, that had good upper level leadership. I found that the culture was not aligned with my strengths, and decided that I wanted to work somewhere that valued innovation and creativity. Good opportunity for me if I was coming out of College.  Wrong Place at my current Career timetable.  Enjoyed the work, but needed more pay at the time of my life consistently. I did not like northwestern mutual. i did not like working there.  the people we\\'re only interested in making money and pushing expensive whole like insurance policies. Great location and work culture. It is a very challenging work, with long hours and lots of knowledge coming at you. You will spend a majority of your week at the office, but you have a great support system from the veteran advisors. However, management needs work. Was an awful experience can be summarized in one phrase: pyramid scheme the rich get richer and the poor continue to starve. Overall an awful job to start out a career in the financial planning world. Great Training but only to work her as a resume booster. Need to generate your own leads. Primarily sell life insurance and do not like it when you try to broker and use other companies. Stressful environment if you aren\\'t hitting your weekly expectations for number of meetings you set. They teach you to build your business through your personal network and can be uncomfortable asking family and friends to buy life insurance from you. A typical day involves calling and cold-calling to improve book of business. Most of the time is spent on the road trying to help clients reach financial security. very hgih paced working enviorment where you talk to alot of people throughout the day and you must make alot of phone calls to potential clients and set up meeings. Lack of training on financial products but pretty of role-playing to teach you how to get referrals for more reps to replace you. Quick to tell you to bug your family and friends for insurance sales. If you can gather your own leads and work a ton to make a very inconsistent pay-check, maybe this is for you. Loved working with Northwestern for 10 years; moved crossed country twice! The more people I met, the more great people I found! One huge family with a passion to helping clients reach their financial goals! This job is all about timing.  Having good support in the beginning and a lot of diligence. First year will be rough. They have good training for new hires.   Lots of people do what you will be trying to do. High level of customer  and representative interaction on a daily basis. Various responsibilities that were both on and added later to job description upon being hired. It lacked definitive management and on location HR department that made it difficult to voice any concerns. Out of city supervisors that made it difficult to gauge my level of accomplishment on a day to day basis. Everyone in the office in Grand Forks office was fun to work with and engaging to college students. The advisors in there were very helpful and wanted us to do our best. If you want to work at Northwestern Mutual, it can be a very fulfilling experience. The team is there to help you as much as possible, but be aware that nothing will be handed to you. You must be passionate about what you do, and be ready to never truly be off the job. The biggest thing is to always be able to put yourself out there and meet new people to expand your market. Commission based career in the financial industry selling insurance products and financial planning packages. Can be tough if you don\\'t have a good network of clients. North Western Mutual is a firm that goes beyond wealth and asset consultation, income protection, education planning, and investments. Its network of advisers, and access to a diverse set of world class investment tools helps businesses and families make finance easy.  I will always recommend representative/adviser positions to close friends/family. They expect you to work 50+ hours a week, with little appreciation for the extra hours. The pay is less than competing companies pay their employees. The management gets a lot of perks, including paid vacations and shorter work weeks. Everyone else is worked very hard with few opportunities. You hassle everyone you know to come see you and you look at everyone as a number. It\\'s commission only so it has it\\'s benefits at times where you make a lot of money some months. Full Commission, you earn what you put in which has its positives and it\\'s negatives. You rely on your own book of business or you will be cold calling. Training is intense especially if you are  not familiar with this industry. Focused more on Life Insurance rather than investments Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Previously known as a great place to work with great job security and great benefits.  ,The culture has changed significantly during the 35+ years of my employment at the NM home office.,Gone are the days of a close knit family orientated culture with industry leading health insurance plans with reasonable premiums for employees and retirees. Gone are the days of job security for employees that performed their jobs.  Gone are the days of a pension plan that rewarded long term employees for dedication to the company.  ,If you are a young job hopping millennial attracted to new shiny objects and want to work in a new silicon valley wannabe home office environment, Northwestern Mutual and/or Northwestern Mutual Investment Services may be the place for you... Terrible experience - very, very poor training given for a job that deals in legal contracts, unrealistic work load expectations.  All clients were not treated the same -  manager catered to the high end, wealthier clients.  Office could not keep a recruiter because of the pressure to \"convince\" young people to join the company.  Lots of negative comments about other agents in the office.  Very negative environment. Great Company to work for. The training program is one of the best in the nation and it truly prepares you for a career in the financial advisor industry. The internship was just a way for them to get leads on life and health insurance. You do not learn much if anything at all and it is essentially unpaid. It\\'s a job if you really need one! If the managing partner thinks you look the part then you may have a shot. It is not for faint of heart. There is money to be made but you will grind to get it. I\\'m an intern, so I can\\'t speak too well on any of the other positions besides mine, but I liked everyone I work with! The office management does a great job at encouraging everyone This is still a great company. I learned a great deal about insurance products here even though I had been in the business for the previous nine years. Best insurance company in the business. Loves the people and atmosphere. Loved the products they sold. They treated their clients really well. Advisors were well trained. They drain your book of friends/family/references and only about 5% make it through month 6.  Want 15-20 face to face meetings/week kept along with another 5-10 internal meetings micromanaging you - very draining, not for everyone. Great co-workers; heavy sales focus (which I didn\\'t enjoy, but some do); good benefits; great training program; supportive and competitive environment Its a very good place to work with a centralized testing team.,You will be placed multiple small projects which keeps you busy.,Most important thing is, you will get free lunch every day. Not the same stand up company it used to be. Company changed and I feel they really don\\'t care about its employees. Well at least the lunch is free... Learned a lot through the company.  The internship program is an intense setting where they treat the interns as if they were full time employees.  Very hands on environment. Working hard and selling was a big part of my job. You need to Gove yourself a chance and if you are able to make it to 5 years, you will be rich, with clients and pay. Fulfilling but not for someone that is not comfortable selling to friends and family. Cut throat culture! Some guys are not very accepting. Hardest part of job was commission only pay structure. You get in what you put out it is definitely not the easiest of careers to start off in especially being a young collage grad. However it can be done just got to break through the learning curve to see the real success. Good opportunity for vertical growth. Hard work. Must go through a licensing process. Get to learn about the sales cycle. Hardest part of the job is the cold calling and most enjoyable is making a sale. It was a great place to work with a wonderful culture. the management really does try to help you out throughout the entire process. The training is beyond anywhere else in the industry. Calling friends and family to get started and working 12 hour days M-Th. Difficult to to set meetings with people you do and don\\'t know. It\\'s a very important topic that everyone needs to look into but a lot of people don\\'t care. The culture is cut throat and dull. Everyone is just out for themselves because that is how Northwestern Mutual\\'s business model is set up. Only 1 out of 10 agents make it two years. The biggest hurdle is to mentally deal with the constant rejection every day. The benefit is knowing when someone meets with you, they learned something new and that you made a financial impact in their lives. It was decent. Insurance is a tough business. I wouldn\\'t recommend this job to anyone who isn\\'t willing to work extremely hard or that doesn\\'t want to push family and friends to buy insurance. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Great company to work for if you can maintain the activity and get in front of the right type of people. Discipline is the key to achieving and maintaining success. On paper, Northwestern Mutual seems like a great place to work. Wonderful benefits, highly rated each year as an employer, etc. However, the culture itself is difficult. Office politics is the worst I have ever encountered. Great Atmosphere, great people, difficult job, difficult income stability. If you want to spend more time focusing on building clients than actually helping people, this is the way to go. Took me two months to even get a customer due to training and lack of people willing to protect their lives and secure their loved ones financially. 100% dedication needed to establish your practice, very tough with kids, family. I like working at NM very much but have to find another job that works better with raising my young son. a good opportunity if you know a lot of wealthy people who trust you without knowing you very well.  Calling up people to get in their business was not for me.  All members of the oppostie gender think it\\'s a date. As the title said, this internship position allows you to test-drive a career as a financial advisor and gives you meaningful real world experience therein. Looks good on the resume, too. Hard to get compensated real well, though (purely commission-based), for the amount of work you put in. Great Company, Good Management, Good Balance, Good people, teaches how to network, your own boss, your own schedule, have to be disciplined, not 9-5.. The pay is low for the industry, their is a cut throat culture that encourages people to stab each other in the back to get ahead, management treats all employees even fellow management as hourly employees punching a clock. The benefits are horrible. The current CEO is destroying everything that was good about the company. Relaxed, but busy.  Lots of paperwork but enjoyed working with different clients.  The home office provided excellent support.  All the employees are friendly and helpful. In my current position I have learned quite so much in regards to underwriting in so little time. I\\'ve learned about medical impairments, treatment, and symptoms. I\\'ve learned how to make an assessment based on the information provided in the client\\'s medical records. I also learned about certain prescriptions and the different impairments the medication can be used to treat.  I understand the importance of having our agent\\'s and client\\'s be honest in the process which allows underwriters to their job more effectively. As a whole, this organization is a good starting point for many. In my time with the company, I only met a handful of agents who had made a career of being a financial representative, but for the ones who found success at it, it was very lucrative. I think the longer you stay with this organization, the more focus and emphasis gets placed on investment work, but the company offers plenty of opportunity and resources to get licensed to sell insurance products and investment products. This is an excellent organization to join if you are strong at networking as many roles are sales-oriented and depend on you generating your own client leads. While still a good company to work it is not the place it used to be.  NMs PR team has managed to keep the company story of the layoffs out of the news and focus on the hiring they are trying to do. Fast Paced environment, not for everyone but if you enjoy sales then it could be well compensated. Insurance is a lucrative business where you have the ability to make good money. I was the Lead Solutions Architect  at Northwestern Mutual. I met with engineers as well as vendors and developed the company roadmap for 2 years and 5 years out. Good potential but be ready to dedicate your entire life. Also just a bit morbid to have to talk about potential death everyday so it would have been interesting to include other types of insurance. A typical day at work for a financial representative includes calling and scheduling meetings with clients, going to meetings with clients, and training twice a week. I would highly recommend NM as an employer for their modern-take on working.  They are on the cutting edge of Agile/SCRUM and really work as a team.  ,I found that I could use multiple skills and even-though I was a contract-worker I could move to different roles that needed to be filled. ,The best part of NM are the people - very welcoming and willing to help you learn and advance.  ,If I had not been in a contract role I would still be there today. Culture is great and competitive. The job gives you amazing opportunities to learn and grow. Management department is lacking. You make a difference in peoples lives Bad experience, bad training, Work life balance sucks, managers steal renewals when reps leave, very low success rate, they do not give you full disclosure during interview NM is a great company to work for. They are a company that you can grow with and they have helped me grow professionally. The people there welcome you with open arms and are always willing to lend a helping hand. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. it was a supportive environment, but I couldn\\'t financially afford to pay to \"work\"-- suddenly self employed was not what I signed up for. My friends and family did not like me asking for referrls. Interning at NMFN provided opportunities to not only learn about the insurance industry, but to connect with people in various circles as well.  The role required serious self-examination to determine your goals. Competitive work environment,You get out what you put in,Hard-working, forward-thinking individuals with the time and the resources to build their own business from the ground up will thrive I learned the independent, entrepreneurial spirit of financial representatives.  Start building the foundation in finance, insurance, and sales that will help you deliver excellent financial security to your clients. ,Lay the foundation for a client base and a successful practice, with support from your office colleagues and the company. At Northwestern Mutual, you\\'ll work for yourself but never by yourself. Overall positive and great place to work at and really great. I learned a lot of skills,•\\tGuide clients through a financial planning process, which reflects Northwestern Mutual’s belief that over a lifetime, most people will experience many different financial needs and circumstances,•\\tRecommend and provide insurance and investment solutions to help meet client’s financial security goals,•\\tGained excellent and professional communication skills through talking to clients in person and on the phone,•\\tObtained interpersonal skills through building relationships with clients,•\\tBuilding a clientele and personal network,•\\tSell and educate clients on Northwestern Mutual’s product line Management is very poor, no opportunity for growth, work life balance is a joke,  health care rates going up, lot of offshoring as ,offshore employees can work almost 24/7 as most of them are single and have nothing else to do but work - its like blue collar work in a white collar industry. Wonderful office full of kind helpful people. Foosball table in case you need a stress free break. Plenty of smart driven people to learn from. Would recommend Norwalk\\'s office to anyone. If you can get referred well it is an unbelievable opportunity.  No salary makes it exceedingly difficult to succeed.  Must have a large number (300 minimum) of extremely warm referrals to call starting out. They paint a great picture but in reality it is cut throat and you never know if you are going to get paid or not. The training is great and will help in other careers, otherwise I do not recommend it. - How to interact with clients on a professional level ,- How to prepare different financial documents for Senior Financial Advisors ,- How to use MS Dynamics 365 Fun work environment good company. I felt they like all wanted everyone to succeed and do well. Competitive but pushed each other to do better. Loved working here I loved this company. I really felt that my co workers want to see new employees succeed. The managers are very friendly and willing to help when needed. They will pay for your licenses and marketing material but you are running your own business so if you don\\'t work, you don\\'t eat.  This is a pure commission position. I worked for NM for years, and I can\\'t think of a more admired or stable financial company, or one with more integrity - in fact, no matter what happens for me professionally, I won\\'t move my investments from NM and will NEVER move or cancel my life insurance. The conviction the workforce has around NM\\'s products is exceptional, because the products themselves are exceptional, and this conviction elevates those who work there. There\\'s definitely a sense of belonging to a mission for good when you work here. This sense of belonging helps create closeness among those in the same offices and agencies, which is wonderful - I felt a tremendous amount of affection and respect for my colleagues, and the quality of my life has been enhanced by their friendships.,That said, as a team member - NOT as a financial rep; I can\\'t speak to that - there are some drawbacks:,- There\\'s a lot of gender stratification in terms of the roles. While this isn\\'t the case 100% of the time, the men tend to be the sales reps and the lead advisors, and women comprise most of the support staff. From the outside looking in, this is anachronistic; from the inside looking out, while you get used to it, it\\'s can be demoralizing. There are efforts to recruit and maintain more women, and there are several woman-led teams that are just absolutely crushing it, but it still looks and can feel like quite the boys\\' club.,- Related: the company - at least in the Denver area, but perhaps nationwide - is guided in large part by Christians, and/or political conservatives with Christian values. Again, this isn\\'t, every team, nor is this a drawback per se, but for those who weren\\'t raised in that faith tradition or for those with more progressive leanings, the emphasis on faith and Christian practices can be jarring and even off-putting.,- Assistant or associate financial reps (AFRs) aren\\'t technically employees of NM; they\\'re employees of the financial representatives (FRs) who hire them. So, while NM is a large company that employs at least 20,000 people nationwide, when you join a team as an AFR, you\\'re essentially working for a small business. The impact of this is that your employing FR may or may not have the means or desire to offer you the compensation you need, nor is there a lot of consistency between teams\\' compensation practices that you can look to in order to bolster your case for getting more than you\\'re offered. This also means that AFRs aren\\'t extended the opportunity to participate in the company\\'s health care or retirement plans - the establishment of these plans are, again up to your individual employer.,- While most FRs offer bonuses and salary increases to their teams based on the achievement of annual performance goals, there\\'s not a lot of positional advancement as an AFR. You may be tapped to be the investments specialist, or to run the financial plans, or to get in front of clients and conduct meetings on your own, or to fill different roles as needs arise or as new team-members come onboard (that\\'s working in a small business for you - never boring!), but your success is contingent on your boss\\'s success, and your professional advancement is bounded by theirs. And this may be perfectly fine for you! MANY of my colleagues loved their jobs and saw being an AFR as the best way to serve their clients, their team, their families, and their communities. I also know many AFRs who are very highly compensated. However, it\\'s not uncommon to talk to AFRs who are frustrated by their lack of career advancement. So, if you know that you skew ambitious, keep this in mind when evaluating hour hiring team, and the reality of your position won\\'t clash with your expectations. I loved the people I worked with but there was a lot of unreimbursed expenses especially if you live in a rural area. Also Payroll is every 2-3 weeks. Most important information I obtained at North Western Mutual were my sale skills and methods. I was able to get my nerves and self confidence up with sales. NM is a great place to work but should only be for those who are looking to go into sales and are truly interested in financial planning.  Selling insurance is extremely difficult and should not be something put on the backs of college students in order to make money. Almost everyone that works here, especially the Lonetree Office is very nice and helpful. It just wasn\\'t the right environment for me and I would only suggest becoming a representative if it is your true passion in life and you can give your all for the next 5-10 years of your life. I was not a representative but I saw people crumble under the pressure almost everyday. They sell you on building your business and make you call your relatives and friends to sell whole life insurance.  Coworkers were okay but not a great experience there. It\\'s hard to get everything done.  Not enough time in the day and gets extremely stressful when you have to rely on people to act in order to get paid.  100% commission is rough but it is a good percentage though. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. As an Intern you are kind of thrown to the sharks in a sense that you are given no leads and the first thing they tell you is to ask your friends and family to buy their products. From there you must ask those people who they know and so on and so forth.  Would not recommend if you don\\'t already know at least 75+ solid people you can sell to up front. Totally a sales job with commissions only. Freedom to run your day is the image they tell you, but it\\'s all about selling insurance to your friends and family. NW mutual was extremely helpful for advancing my professional life. My experience as an Intern taught me tons about the insurance industry as well as furthered my sales skill set. I really enjoyed working for Northwestern Mutual, because they care about their employees. They show this by offering free lunch everyday! I always looked forward to the amazing food that they would prepare for us everyday. It was definitely a perk of the job. To start with, the most amazing part of this company is it does not let you feel like you are a employee. It feels like a family. Work is good and great seniors to guide. You feel you are in safe hands.,Management: Starting with the million dollar smile HR, she is an amazing person. Not sure how she manages to make sure each of us are being noticed, acknowledged, appreciated. Best HR i have ever worked … The workplace culture was great, all employees were helpful and very welcoming. There is large potential for growth in the company, you get out what you put in while working at Northwestern Mutual. A typical day includes meeting with people and reviewing their financial situation. What this job taught me was how to confidently speak in front of people, and to be self-sufficient in the work place. The hardest part of the job is definitely prospecting for new clients, but all in all it is an amazing place to work with great benefits. The workplace culture is wonderful. The hardest part of starting off as a Financial Representative Assistant is that there is very limited training, if any. It would be great if the office had training programs and different methods to learn the systems and processes; especially for a recent grad. I learned through my office that this career is  hard one to start. But this company and office that I worked for were the best people. I learned the value of a sound financial plan and that I will always be appreciative of the MD there taking a chance on me right out of college. This was a wonderful internship opportunity that i\\'m happy I got to take part in. You get to dive head first into what its like being a financial advisor and running your own practice. Though there is opportunity to be very successful not many people are. Very cut throat competitive environment. Support staff are used and not rewarded or recognized. Inadequate training provided and no structure provided for expectations etc. Very good at allowing us to grow within the company as well as employees. Good pay and good culture to challenge us and gave us great training on how to be successful. Because it is in transition, it is difficult to know where things will end up, but they are working hard on employee engagement, and making the work environment attractive to millennials. Great company but their internship is them just benefiting off of your contacts. I guess it\\'s for \"self starters\" but an internship should be learning a whole industry\\'s in\\'s and outs. A typical day at Northwestern Mutual includes walking to my cubicle checking emails and voicemails and pulling up the proper programs to start the day. Here I learned how to read certain codes that dealt with insurance policy applications, and match them to certain things in the computer\\'s database. Management was always around if there were any questions and always kept in touch via email or instant messaging. The hardest part of the job would have to be constantly having to get used to new changes that seemed to happen very often when it came to application input. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know new people and learning about the different cultures of my fellow coworkers. This job sounds great throughout the interview process but in reality the market is incredibly saturated. Do your research on the industry before agreeing to take this job. This was the toughest internship I have had in terms of the tasks at hand. Expecting you to sell life insurance as a young inexperienced individual is tough. NML offers a variety of mini-environments within its corporation and is a fun place to work that caters to the employees. You feel like part of a team at NML. • Built tremendous relationships with clients and made them feel comfortable doing business with me and Northwestern Mutual.,• Organized meetings each day, and made 200 dials every week to potential clients to build my business and expand the brand.,• Profiled and analyzed investment products to develop customized financial strategies for clients\\' financial needs and aspirations.,• Formulated asset allocation strategies and developed proprietary investment models for client portfolios.,• Coordinated portfolio reviews with clients to regularly evaluate investment performance to efficiently achieve documented long-term financial goals. The people were all great and I liked to learn from them and all the training they had availble. They also had an accountability team and supervisor and weekly meetings to help you thrive and stay on target. Do not work there if you are afraid of phone calls and asking people you know to buy from you. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Overall good experience. They put a lot of stress on you and there are constantly new people coming and going. Not for everyone. Sales job but there are learning oppurtunities Nothing wrong with high expectations, but the salary and earning potential should match that, which they do not. No real room for advancement unless you fully drink the koolaid, or are a family member of management. They say being a contractor is the way to get in the organization. I truly hope so because I love the company, job, and people. The only reason i would leave is when my contract is either up or because as a contractor I get no paid holidays, vacation, etc. That can be hard when you have a family to support. Overall flexibility is amazing and management is great. This was just an internship and quickly realized its not a place I wanted to work at. Selling life insurance can be a shady job that manipulates young people to essentially hand over their family contacts the older reps so they can soicate them I loved the workplace culture. NM did a great job training new employees. It was a fun place to work and build long lasting friendships. Everyone was encouraging of one in other. There is a lot of room for growth but if you start in the call center there is a 22-24 month commitment before you are able to apply to another position internally. Culture was bad; not good leadership within local office.  You are completely in control of your destiny with this company which is cutthroat, so any guidance and luck would be helpful--just don\\'t expect it. Phone potential and perspective clients with the intent to set a meeting to discuss financial planning. You set your own schedule. After you phone for about two hours you are then in the field conducting client meetings. Working for Northwestern Mutual was as rewarding as it was challenging. The perfect payoff! I benefited from knowing the ins and outs of insurance policy as a whole, whether it be what was most necessary for me at what time or what will pay me back the most in the long run when the time comes. I received amazing leadership that made networking easy and enjoyable, and was able to realize the value I was making in others\\' lives. It was a great work experience. They provide you with weekly training and sales mentor-ship. You learn how to call, prospect, and lead in person meeting. A typical day at work consisted of cold-calling and meeting with potential clients. I learned multiple facets of the sales cycle but I did not enjoy the work environment. It was a very cut-throat work environment and each person always seemed to be stressed. The hardest part of the job was having to find your own clients as a young college person. I enjoyed shadowing and going with different sales associates to learn how they set up their sale with clients. At Northwestern Mutual, I experienced an environment where I could always ask for help no matter the circumstance. That is one of their core values is helping people within their company succeed to their fullest potential. Knoxville, TN office has collaborative and competitive office culture, great group of people, mentoring, people who care about your success, tons of room to advancement The staff and eveyone involved at NWM seemed to have my best interest at heart, but most seemed to be in it for themselves. Not all were that way, but more times than not. I did learn plenty about the job and how they wanted you to \"sell\" which was helpful for any type of position at any company. You were encouraged to work with other sr reps which is a good way to learn the business, until you can confidently go out and make presentations yourself. There was always someone there who knows much more about any one thing than you which was good bc it gave me a chance to bounce different things off of them as they had likely dealt with it in the past. The most enjoyable part was the work hard play hard mentality. They were very family oriented and liked to get the whole family involved in after work activities. Customer service calls were the largest part of the workday; answering questions about insurance policies, claims, etc.,With under 20 employees at this location, it became something of a family with good collaborative efforts among coworkers.,Benefits were good, pay was adequate for the job being performed. Well established company with solid products.  Great training program.  Collegial environment.  Fast paced business suitable for people with high drive and motivation. It is very difficult to advance in your career unless you work for the corporate office. It is hard to grow your own business from the gourd up especially if you are young. Enjoy who I work for as a company and my direct manager.  No micro-managing and enjoy the flexibility.  Very supportive and understanding when it comes to work/life balance. This is a top notch financial company and will use their services for personal use.  However as a career choice it is not something that I would recommend for everyone.  It can be an extremely fulfilling and rewarding career but as high as the highest high, are the lowest of the lows.  It takes someone with a drive for sales and finance to maintain commitment to this position.  It is a high standards company and the minimums are do able with a killer instinct mindset on a daily basis.  Not much creativity gets to be had as everything is on a very highly polished system.  The language is perfected, the sales system is perfected, all you have to do is show up every day and desire to be successful.  That is easier said than done however, you are the owner, operator, secretary, and janitor.  That being said there are many many other advisers willing to help but you must immerse yourself in the industry to be successful.  It is a sink or swim position, no showing up to work and punching a time clock. NML used to be \\'the\\' place to work. My last year of employment there was cut-throat. The hardest part of the job was knowing if you \\'had\\' a job, and also trying to trust coworkers in an environment where layoffs were on everyone\\'s minds. It created a very negative and hostile environment. . ,Management was not trustworthy, honest nor reliable. typical work day is full of accomplishment, Cli, and client focus. Results driven, and looking to give the client the best possible client experience. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Overall NML is a good company to work for. Like all companies they have areas of improvement they need or could focus on. However, I had a good run with them. Right place to work for some people. It is tough career but can be very rewarding and you can be very successful. You will be making a lot of calls and working hard. My last position as administrative assistant to a top financial representative at Northwestern Mutual included answering telephone, providing customer service, scheduling appointments, handling the processing of insurance applications, etc. Fast paced and overwhelming place with not enough hours. Leadership lacks at communication with the rest of the team. Not enough hours in a week’s worth of work. Northwestern Mutual is built on Life Insurance as a company which provides excellent risk management and principles for financial planning.  The management is supportive and driving toward productivity results using the Granum production system.  Overall, great culture and values driven to insurance sales productivity results. - Typical work day included holding interviews and dials ,- I learned to challenge myself and grew immensely ,- Management was wonderful, very open, caring and transparent ,- Workplace culture was warm and friendly ,- The hardest part of the job was setting goals daily ,- The most enjoyable part was the coworkers! I had a great experience working with Northwestern Mutual. I learned a lot about sales and cold calling. One of the most important skill I acquired was learning to lead a meeting. I was able to listen in on my boss and here how a cold call should be handled. I tried my own pitch and worked on perfecting it so I can tailor it to any potential client. Responsible for responding to regulatory inquiries, filing U4 amendments and “for cause” Form U5s, investigating and responding to customer complaints, reviewing and approving outside business activities Responsible for ensuring the Contract, License and Registration department’s policies and procedures comply with all regulatory requirements and Company standards. Wonderful mentors that were always willing to go out of their way to help you. Lots of learning on the job of the financial services industry. Best thing I learned how to do is complete the full sales process from contacting prospects to closing deals. Meetings were not too long and the content and technology in the office was superb. The amenities for lunch and breakfast were free and that helped save money for employees. There were always good training courses. Not a great place to work if you want to make money. You are basically sold into thinking you are going to make all of this money by field directors but the reality s you are soliciting your family and friends only receiving a portion of the comission. Good people, work environment is very nice. Work load is very heavy, can be quite stressful. Job is very varied, customer service interactions can be good and bad as with any position. The demise of NM as an employer has accelerated over the last 3 years. Firstly the great pension rip off to build the new building. The whole bonus structure was designed to funnel money upwards. They executives have a mechanism to defer salary to avoid tax. They are everything that stinks about corporate America. Off course the staff just have to take worried for their jobs and benefits. When is the country going to learn that employer provided health care gives the company too much leverage over the staff............freedom! This intern was very challanging and introduced me to the world of finance. I found it to be competitive and also became knowledgeable about adjusting to different incomes. Great culture ,Competitive,Great Compensation,Make your own schedule, but be willing to put in the time in order to be successful,No real help in cultivating business Northwestern Mutual was a great employer. The job was fast-pace, fun, and paid well. Overall great experience. My managers were very responsive to my needs and helpful. Fast paced, must be a people person, ultimate freedom and will get out what you put in. Good management, training is intuitive, good for people who are driven. Commission based only, good for go getters who dont mind calling all friends and family to make them clients. Unlimited income and you work your own schedule. Management was the good \\'ole boys club.  You were expected to act a certain way, talk a certain way, dress a certain way and drive a certain type of vehicle. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. The work and vision of this company is second-to-none in my opinion, very steep earning potential making it hard to get off to a fast start. Thats all. Northwestern Mutual is an incredible company, especially to work with; however, you will need to bring with you your own pool of initial contacts to begin finding prospective clients. It\\'s tough, a little uncomfortable at the start, but if you can continue to generate names to show your work to, you\\'ll succeed. The job is self paced and you control your pay which helps extrinsic motivation. The meetings are split between people when you start off and then you can branch off. Contact me directly for more feedback!  I\\'m happy to provide additional information, but it would take too long to list it all here.  Feel free to contact me. Northwestern Mutual office has been a great place to work. It is a new and fast paced office that is rapidly growing. It has a fun environment with good benefits. The management team is really focused on making you successful in your career. I have been able to learn so much from my peers. You have to be very disciplined especially when you\\'re first starting out. They want you to produce 100 lives your first year. If you have the opportunity to do the internship program I highly recommend it. You have 6 months to build your clientele base and if you\\'re hired full time after then you\\'re able to hit the ground running. Unfortunately, I wasn\\'t offered an internship spot and I went into the business with a poor natural market. They wanted me to get out of my natural market and build life long relationships with these people. Unfortunately, I wasn\\'t able to build life long relationships with people outside of my natural market as quickly as they wanted so they fired me 60 days after hiring me. Typically a lot of work to do and people to meet but friendly and productive work environment. It is a great company but there is a lot of work and it is a process working with potential clients. The culture of the company was laid back but competitive at the same time. Management made you want to work hard and grow your practice, and if you didn\\'t put in the work you had little chance to succeed. This culture was one that I thrived in because I am very competitive and always want to out work the person sitting next to me. The reason I left, was because the Internship took up too much time from school and it became difficult run a club sport, do my school work, and  do the internship as well. The position of Financial Representative is commission based. The work involved early on needs to be focused on networking and meeting as many potential clients as you can. If you don\\'t fill up your pipeline enough or aren\\'t seeing the right type of people your income will suffer. I enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual for 15 years and learned so much. I\\'ve had the opportunity to work with several executives for the company. Each position was fast-paced and had many responsibilities to go with it. Great company and leadership, Takes a lot of conviction to diligently get in front of people and show them the process. There are a lot of people willing to help get you where you need to be Sometimes the business office can be pretty cliquey. Kind of like high school lunch. If you are not in the \"in\" group you will be left out of some of the company activities. Great company with great management. Time consuming work that takes a strong backbone to persevere through. Great people just difficult and grueling work. Enjoyed working with the teams and the clients. Afforded many opportunities for new environments and opportunities that allowed growth in a number of technical areas. Great Personal Growth Opportunity. Strong Leadership. Unlimited Income Potential. High Demand. Self-Directed Schedule. Great Long-Term Career. Heavy Stress. I enjoyed my time at Northwestern Mutual.  A typical work day consisted of getting your work assignments and trying to complete them by the end of the day.  The company has many resources that are able to assist you with your job function. Everyone at Northwestern Mutual is a wonderful group of highly educated, enthusiastic, ambitious group of people that want to make the business more successful.  Fill up your sales pipeline and you\\'ll make a handsome living.  If you\\'re lazy, you\\'ll fail. Good place to work for certain personalities. Competitive job and it is a very slow start trying to build up a clientele but it can be good in a long term career. As an assistant for a FR I managed client cases as they moved through the underwriting process. I communicated with medical companies, home office representatives, clients, and the underwriters. ,I also managed the FR marketing campaigns, website, and calendar. ,The hardest part of the job was the work load and amount of attention to detail needed. Good communication between AFR\\'s and the FR is necessary Though this company does much good in training you, this is still YOUR BUSINESS, and you alone are ultimately responsible for your development, expenses, and success! Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Love the company and mission behind what we do. It is a great opportunity for a driven individual Work harder now for a lifetime of perks your peers won\\'t receive. It is a very tough business to be in.  Majority of people do not want to deal with Financial Advisors.  They feel FA are another typical salesman and want to run another direction This employer is great to work for, they off free meals. job advancement, great pay, paid holidays and vacations, supervisors were very supportive and always offer encoragement Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work. It can prove challenging, but there are systems put in place to ensure you succeed. Do not come expecting to see success without putting in the work. I was an Intern for 2 years. Within that time frame, I earned two sponsored trips to Milwaukee, Wisconsin for their home office meeting and learned so much from being involved with all of the office activities. The culture is amazing, and management is all about developing you and your financial advising practice. They are also very focused on there NM Impact program, and always looking to serve the community. Has a great training program for new financial representative, room for advancement, a professional culture.  A company that delivers their promise to their clients. I really enjoyed the work that I was doing with Northwestern Mutual. The only issue was that their was not any financial support for individuals starting their career. A lot of the success depended upon who you knew. If you did not know a lot of people in the area you lived you would have to work longer hours in order to find prospects. I resigned because I started to feel that I was helping people become financially secure while I felt financially insecure on a daily basis. I learned a lot during the internship about life insurance. The job itself was to call friends and family and try to sell them life insurance. wouldn\\'t want to work there full time. I quit halfway through the internship because I ran out of money and the pay was all commission. The job is solely dependent on your attitude and how hard you\\'re willing to work. If you\\'re sociable and are relatively intelligent, you\\'ll do well at pioneer a typical day at work we would login and check the calendar on whose assigned what for the day. I learned all about security access management. The location of building is nice and People at work are relaxed. Hardest part of job is trying to manage being on phones and getting timed tasks done. Which i think they should give overtime. I enjoy the free lunch here at work NWM is an insurance and investment company that is a leader in the industry. The office and management staff are very nice and helpful. The atmosphere is relaxed. Before starting in this industry I would tell anyone that is contemplating on working as a representative to be aware of the fact that this is a compensation job in which you have to be wary of low income through long stretches of low production. Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work. The company values hard work, commitment, excellence and integrity! In addition, Northwestern Mutual has one of the BEST internship programs out there! company cares about you soliciting all your friends and family. Joint work is required at the company, few times my clients felt uncomfortable with another person being brought in Just make sure you know exactly what you are signing up for before starting. They have a great training program and they do a good job at making everything seem amazing. Just be aware this is a commission only job - so make sure you are financially ready to start this career b/c you will be without income in the beginning. Plus, the sales cycle for most clients is 60-90+ days so it could be 5-6 months before anything substantial starts rolling in. Also, all fees and expenses are yours to pay. This is a business (your business) and you have to pay for everything. The longer you stay the more you pay. They do help a little in the beginning. ,It is a great opportunity for the right people - just do your homework. Good luck!! Do you want to sell insurance and pretend it\\'s financial planning services? Do you want to work at a company that is an industry leader yet simultaneously is like every other sales company? Look no further! Typical day is anything you want it to be. You have all day to call client referrals to set meetings or to attend the meetings you already have scheduled. You get out what you put into this job. In the beginning you really have to hustle and work hard on educating yourself and getting comfortable in front of people to grow your business. But if this a career you want to do the possibilities and rewards are endless. It is a commission based job so you have push yourself to get the outcome you desire. The entire office is welcoming and the management is awesome. They really value their internship program here and there are so many people willing to help you succeed and push you to your limits if that is what you desire. The whole office is like a big family and always motivating you to keep moving up. The great thing in this internship and job is the freedom to choose your own schedule. You are technically your own boss and can come and go as you please, however the more you are in the office the more likely you are to be successful. Weilert WUnderlick Armstrong is a great environment to learn and became proficient at financial planning however the work culture is negative, harsh, and unorganized. I enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual as they took care of their employees well. Good benefits and job security. However things took a turn when they began layoffs and large scale offshoring. A great place to work as a full time employee,excellent benefits and paid time off. Friendly management team willing to train you on any interest you desire. The hardest part of this job was the daily commute.  Most people there were very friendly.  The company had a great technology platform that made the job easier. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. As a financial representative you are in control of your schedule and success. You have a leadership and development team which supports you throughout your first few years. this was a temporary job through my high school in a program called On the Job Training, OJT. I learned about answering the phones, filing and communication Top ten national rated internship program. Great experience to be gained for anyone looking to graduate with a business degress. Weekly mentoring and great pay compensation, if you are able to produce. Solid training for interns and good experience for new graduates. Basically use the internship as a resume builder and go find something with a more stable income. I have worked at Nortwestern Mutual for 10 years. While it is a great company to work for, things are drastically changing and a bit unorganized at this point in time. We are changing our culture from conservative to modern to keep up with the ever changing way of the millennial world. I believe over time we will get where we need to be, however the career advancement is lacking in my opinion. I am currently in a call center environment in which is very stressful. High number metrics, micromanagement, and lack of consistency makes a very uneasy environment. Every department is different at NM, and I have worked in great ones in the past. I had some very strong leaders that made coming to work something you looked forward to. Northwestern is a great company and I am proud to say that I have spent 10 years there. However, when there is a lack of strength in leadership, the team suffers the most. Northwestern Mutual is undergoing a \"reinvention\", which has resulted in firing approximately 1/3 of the company. Many of the jobs have been replaced by offshore teams.,The company does not know what they want to be. If you enjoy sales, this is the company for you. The compensation structure is the best in the industry, especially for young representatives. The companies training programs are world class. It is a good sales opportunity for new college graduates.  There was a strong focus on weekly activity and selling insurance.  There is an opportunity to improve the focus on coaching the sales flow and providing stronger product knowledge so that agenta are better aware of the client\\'s best interest. The company gives its employees all the tools to be successful, and explains how to be successful.  Great training program.  ,Treated well and fair,Expects new employees to use personal contacts Was mislead in the total commission I could expect to receive. It\\'s essentially your own business but you have a boss at the same time.  The products are competitive and are good for customers but expensive in comparison to other companies. This was a good first internship for sure and would recommend to people to do so. It is very cutthroat for sure but if you can make it in the business its great. It was a great insurance company to work for.  Their reputation is impeccable and if your looking to sell life/disability insurance this is the place to be.  There are plenty of opportunities for advancement if you put the work in an pass the right tests!!,It wasn\\'t for me because of the irregular income (commission based).  If a commission job is for you, then this is the place you should apply!! really great experience with the company although it is extremely hard to get ahead they promise you alot but you have to put in alot of work overall it was a good learning experience Northwestern Mutual is incredibly cut throat, and you are not put in a position to succeed. You feel incredibly pressured to call your friends and family. If you do not have an incredibly large network it is really hard to get your feet off the ground. With that said, it is incredibly lucrative if you have a network and live a life without fear. Great reputation in the industry! Lots of change and innovation, patience is needed to move forward with the change.  Great benefits (Medical, dental, tuition reimbursement, etc) This job is full of potential if you have the contacts and the drive to make it worth while. Starting out is hard but after a year in the business money shouldn\\'t be an issue. insurance sales and more insurance sales. the lines of business are essentially unlimited in this job. but the looming insurance quota makes it tough. Excellent brand and products. For the right person a very lucrative and fulfilling career can be obtained. First year is the most challenging as you have to build your cliental from the ground up. great management,long hours,commission pay,the people that work there are awesome and very helpful,you will not do well if you do not call people and ask for referrals when in meetings I had a short Financial Representative Internship. The advisors are highly intelligent and qualified, they offer good guidance, but the clientele building requirements will be too much for most interns, myself included. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. It\\'s definitely a place that if you have family working there...you can really do what you want.  The company itself was fine...it\\'s the departments you have to be wary of.  Some are so disorganized, you don\\'t know how they survive even.  Other departments run a tight ship. Northwestern Mutual allows you to be your own boss and take your career into your own hands. I was empowered by management and more senior representatives. Everyone was willing to go out of there way to provide advice, guidance, or join you on meetings. Great place to learn. Northwestern Mutual is a great company for the client but tough for the adviser to get off to a great start. Nothing but very high quality people that work there. Overall great company.  Fast paced, competitive and somewhat stressful, but positives far out weigh negatives.  I only left because I was recruited by my former employer and manager to help build a new department and was a great opportunity. At the time of entry into the industry the market share was poor.  The company and training was great for an insurance and financial services company. I learned a lot about the financial services, such as dealing with insurance policies and investments. Management was decent but there wasn\\'t much culture. Management expects you to create your own leads and was only helpful the first few times you request help. If on those times you weren\\'t able to close new business, the next time you asked for help it became more and more difficult to get help from management. Had good benefits and PTO, but salary was a little light. If you work downtown the commute can be a little rough in the cold. Wish the company had more modern technology. I thought that this company was a good place for my internship, I learned a lot and was certified in life and health insurance which put me ahead when I was applying to other jobs. - Amazing people ,- Learned how to grow professionally, manage time and taught importance of self improvement both in my personal life and professional career.,- Extremely difficult career field but the rewards are beyond any other career field. Northwestern mutual does provide an excellent opportunity to advance your career. However it currently is in a state of change internally that is causing people a bit of stress on the inside. Extremely fulfilling career with the ability to help people financially while also giving you a very lucrative job. Very hard job and takes great discipline. A growing culture to fit in the industry and market place. I had an opportunity to understand the business culture and the mutual values displayed by leaders. While there were major organizational changes in losing a lot of talent, the company strive to do what\\'s best for their policy owners in maintaining profitability. 40 dials everyday. Keep 4-5 meetings a day. Set 5 meetings a day for the following week. Meeting with clients and addressing their financial needs by taking them through our process. Leadership at this firm was really good and therefore resulted in happier employees that worked hard everyday to achieve the office\\'s common goal. A great culture and a reflection of great leadership. Poor leadership and communication. The culture is only as good as your leader and when you have someone in charge that does not lead by example in their personal production or how they lead others it doesnt make for a great office environment. The work is tough, but it pays off in the end. You need to have thick-skin for this job. The company needs to work on diversity, but overall it was a great experience. Currently week 4 as a financial representative for NWM. My first 3 weeks I\\'ve provided my office with double digit points, remarkable as an intern.,Points earned by setting up meeting, opening & closing cases, and getting introduced to potential new clients. ,The job is what I expected from a commission job, and it is true that if you stick to the book and continue thriving that the possibilities are endless. That persistence is what\\'s going to separate the boys from the men. NM has transformed itself from a life insurance company to a financial services company. Part of that transformation has changed the culture from the traditional structure to a more startup firm culture appealing to the millennium generation. This has opened up the company to expanding and growing in the digital marketplace. The company pays well and will always make money for its policyowners. It truly depends on what department you\\'re in and who your manager is as to your job satisfaction. Culture is that you what you\\'re told -- very methodical (finance/actuary - Type A) in their thinking which breeds success. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Commissioned based with no salary. Work on your on time. Everything up to you. Cold Calls, set up your own meetings, and go through with them. Great coworkers who want to see the best for you A very competitive career to be in, however, once you develop a network of people to work with, the possibilities are endless. If you have a job for a few years and develop a network it would be easier for you to grow you business. Real tough to change when you have been successful with one business model for so long.  Good product, yet need a reality check regarding what will lead to future success, and changing culture to get sense of pride back. Great workplace culture.  Friendly and knowledgable management. Great place to learn about the 401k industry from top to bottom.  If you like to help people and make a difference, its the place. The veteran reps are always willing to lend advice and help to the new / incoming reps. You get out of the career 10x what you put in, if you are willing to work hard. This job is not easy - but it is an excellent opportunity. Regardless if you succeed or fail you will be better educated, know what it takes to succeed in this field, and learn more about yourself than you will at any other job. The management and other Financial Advisors and their teams are friendly, supportive, and everyone wants to see you succeed. great place to work at and great leadership. they are always willing to help you and make sure you understand the information. The pay is definitely not bad. ,the customers are always great! You have to be very self-motivated and ready to work every day. It\\'s somewhat cut-throat but can be very rewarding at the same time. Don\\'t be afraid to pick up the phone! You need to have a self starter mentality along with a lot of patience.  You also need to know how to take no for an answer, because nothing is more annoying than a financial rep who doesn\\'t know how to take no for an answer. l assisted Financial advisors and scheduled appointments with prospects for Financial Advisory in insurance services, wealth management, investments, trusts, retirement income etc. I also acquired my health.life and accident insurance producers,It was a lot of work (studying to pass the insurance exam as well as all the other exams that you\\'re required to pass but it was a good learning experience and the staff was genuine and friendly.. A typical day began with a meeting with our supervisor to review goals for that week. After that, we would phone until we set up the required amount of meetings. ,Management is friendly and very helpful, they are constantly checking in to see how your day is going and if there is any way for them to help. ,Workplace culture is very relaxed while also being very demanding, everyone is focused on their individual goals while also being helpful towards others. I became complacent with my job because it was the same every day every week.  There was very little variety in my area.  I did acquire some skills that I still use today.  These are, being able to dissect information that helps management for decisions that helps decisions in the future. They were few and far between.  I met a lot of great agents when I employed there. I respected this company a great deal, and enjoyed my short time working here. Employees were respectful, personable, and enjoyable to work with. Very professional atmosphere. This is a sales job. Don\\'t come in with the assumption that you\\'re dealing with finance, a team behind you runs the numbers for you. You will need to make dozens of phone calls a day. This company gave me the opportunity to move throughout various areas acquiring various skills while learning about many business functions.  The new skills acquired were put to good use as I advanced my career, built knowledge and relationships. If you are interested in financial planning and finance, Northwestern Mutual is a great place to start. If you are not looking to be a financial advisor, Northwestern Mutual may have limited options for career advancement and Call on close friends and family. Money is what you can make out of it. If you don\\'t produce you don\\'t earn. Sell a lot of Life insurance. That is the key to success. I only worked for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance as a temp.  It was part of my schooling.  I did like it but the culture was not one that would allow me to grow in. Typical large corporate environment. Many large projects happening at the same time.  Many teams working on many different projects.  Many people working on many different teams. Our management was very poor it had very little accountability and were not managers of people they were more concerned about daily tasks then their staff and their career development.  The structure to which the area was ran was consistent chaos and the lack of technology held the efficiency and production quality required to meet the goals and standards to which management requested. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Northwestern Mutual Financial Network was a great place to work.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into the financial field.  They had great training programs and wonderful mentoring programs when I was there. You build your own business, yes.  You control your activity and who you meet with, and how many, yes.  But I\\'ve never worked somewhere like this where there was so much support.  It seems that everyone wants you to be successful and is willing to help any way they can, even other advisors.  It\\'s always all about the people, yes, and every firm will probably vary.  I worked in Raleigh, NC.  Yet, the Northwestern Mutual way is a needs-based approached to clients, helping people today, who will help you make a great living tomorrow.  It is not transactional.  It is focused on planning, not necessarily selling, though that is the core of it as far as income. This employer provides an excellent place to work. Employees are truly shown their value through outstanding managerial support, and incredible benefits. They have a great free lunch, training dept for almost every dept is horrible. The work atmosphere is ok, but this place really is about who you know as opposed to what you know. Make connections, because it\\'s really the best way to move up. minimal pay for maximum work and stress, there is a lot of turn over in staff, you will learn a lot of about the process a little at a time, no real training provided though mostly have to figure it out on your own It took about 6 months to get acclimated to all of the systems and workflow but the corporate training and information available was great. The representative I worked for was relaxed and fun. Everyone in the office was friendly and helpful. It was a challenge at first but even though you do face the difficulties of phoning potential clients and starting your own financial practice I worked with so many great people who were willing to help me with my development while I was apart of this program. Great culture and a great learning opportunity. Culture varies greatly depending on department you work in. Some areas require evening and weekend work regularly. Opportunity to work remotely in some areas. Supportive culture - very big in diversity and inclusion efforts and team building. Agile environment - don\\'t expect to do the same thing forever. Client and field-focused. People believe they are helping people with the work they do. A typical day at work consisted of calling on clients, setting up meetings to review their policies. There was training three times a week to go over language training and product training. The workplace culture was lively and a fun atmosphere to be a part of. The hardest part of the job was the research and preparation it took to get prospects to meet and discuss their personal financial situation. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help people choose what was thought to be the best thing for them, financially wise. All Advisors are self employed so when you are hired to work for a Northwestern Mutual Advisor, you are their employee.  They can be a good employer or a bad employer. You are not protected by Northwestern Mutual. You are at the mercy of the Advisor. Northwestern Mutual is an A+ carrier.  Each office is privately owned so each office is different.  The Greater Tampa Bay/O\\'Connell Financial Group is a Network Office so has the most employees, more job security and better office culture than the District Offices. Work with business professionals by understand their vision of their financial goals. Licensed to sell life, health and accident insurance in California. Northwestern Mutual is an amazing company for the right person - the selection process is lengthy, but only to ensure it is a mutual fit on both ends. This career is not for everyone, but they do a good job of ensuring its good for both sides. I enjoyed my time at Northwestern. I hope to return someday, but it just wasn\\'t a good fit for me right now. Regardless, the training they give you is top notch. I\\'ve learned so much about the industry! They have the best products and service, in my opinion. The best thing I took away from this career was learning more about myself and what I wanted out of life.,Financial potential is unbeatable if you can keep up. It\\'s a very challenging career but I\\'d recommend it for the right person, and you never really know if it\\'s right until you try! I loved what I did, I just didn\\'t enjoy the large ability to be taken advantage of in my position. My role was very much subjective to tasks and activities, so the role was not fully described when I received the job offer, and for the amount of work I did and amount of overtime I did (even as a salaried employee), I was not compensated properly. I had a base salary, but that\\'s it. One Christmas bonus was awarded, but none of the promised bonuses were ever given, no benefits whatsoever were offered, and the office gets so hectic during 2 periods of the year, that no one is ever in a good mood or excited to go to work at all. Allowed me to go out of my boundaries and make my own calls to grow my own business.  Was certainly a great work environment and a great place to grow in your career. After awhile the work becomes repetitive and boring.  Many callers don\\'t understand their annuities at all.  Department was understaffed.  People would transfer out or leave completely, leaving an increased burden on those left behind. Northwestern Mutual exploits the temp agency system in order to keep a herd of workers on hand they can pay less with no benefits and fire at any time. If you actually manage to get hired on permanently (one of my co-workers had been a \"temp agent\" for them for 3 years I\\'m not kidding), then I\\'m sure it\\'s a nice place to work! But getting cheated out of the most basic benefits a full time worker usually enjoys by staying stuck in contractor status isn\\'t a job worth writing home about. At Goodwin, Wright the message is all about work ethic which is a great focus for the office culture to be centered around. During my time there, I picked up many vital habits that not only helped in my working profession, but in life as well. You have to grind in this position to build a practice for yourself. Within the first three years you\\'ll feel overworked and underpaid but after that once you keep sustained activity, you\\'ll feel overpaid for the work you do and create an enormous flexibility with your job. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Northwestern Mutual seems to be a great company to work for.  The issues I had, I believe were associated with the manager I had.  He sought me out and yet never truly valued me as an employee.  I worked very hard for him and did everything I was told and in turn was treated poorly. Lots of change happening.  Job security is not a definite thing as it once was in the past.   Over the years it was a good place to work with hard working, dedicated employees.  Not too sure you see that today.   The shift is work for a few years and move on to a new company.  Do not plan to retire at Northwestern Mutual. The importance of having life insurance became a life mission to me!  Because of its importance, I became a licensed associate after my first year with the company.  I loved coming to work everyday, running the office.  It was great working with two Financial Representatives that had over 30 years of experience (each) which brought its own unique experience.  It was a very clean and professional office located on the 26th floor in a beautiful Atlanta office space.  Although I had to move to another state, I\\'ve always had a place in my heart for the Northwestern Mutual experience! I learned the importance of phone dialing in order to get that foundation relationship with your prospective employee leads, as well as the important factors to look for in a potential candidate. The management is very accommodating and helpful, there is no lack of communication within the team I work with. The hardest part of the job is really digging deep into the resumes online in order to find new and eager people ready for a new challenge. My internship here has given me a lot of day to day skills that will be useful and relevant for my career path. Very structured environment.  Caring and employee focused.,Enjoyed to social aspect as well - staff was like family.,Work and family life very balanced. no benefits, no time off. They allow me to work the hours I want but I get all time off unpaid.  No room for advancement, really looking for something I can grow in. Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work. It requires sales experience as well a designation in life insurance. You start off building your own client base and utilize knowledge of life insurance and financial advising to build savings and financial growth solutions for clients. They have a great training program with lots of quality continuing education.  They have a great group of managers and senior advisers to help guide younger individuals. Very engaging, fast paced and exciting place to work.  The new work spaces are awesome.  It a perfect job for those who are just graduating college.  Great internship program. The training is unparalleled. It is a great place to work! must be a self starter! I would not trade my experience for anything. I would recommend working here if you have the mental capacity to be self motivated each and every day This organization fosters a competitive, friendly, positive, and fun environment.  Management cares about the staff and the teams work hard and collaborate to ensure clients are taken care of. Making cold-calls, prospecting, seeing clients. Learned how to build financial plans and relationships. Great workplace culture. Finding clients was the hardest part. Loved helping people and seeing them progress. Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work as an employee.  The management a culture there are outstanding.  Northwestern Mutual does a great job in career development of their employees. Great company to work for. If you would like to thrive in a healthy and creative culture, NM is the place for you. Strong and Growing ...Setting trends for others in the financial industry I thoroughly enjoy the job. My employer (senior agent) retiring 1-3 years. My employer is retiring one to three years. I am open to many options; marketing, sales, recruiting or educational field of financial planning and risk management. This job is great if you want to control your own destiny and your schedule.  The sky is the limit as far as earnings.  However, you better be prepared to be told no, and have the door slammed in your face on a regular basis.  you really need to believe in what you are doing. The work day at Northwestern Mutual is fast paced without being overwhelming, my peers were easy going and willing to help when needed. They do offer free lunch, a gym, and credit union which made the day a bit less stressful you felt as if there wasn\\'t a struggle to maintain a work life balance. The compensation and benefits were great with pay above average for customer service and benefits that could be discounted for a healthy biometric screening. The most enjoyable part of the day was the variety of work you got throughout the day it kept you always learning. The hardest part of the day would be managing you schedule as there were no designated breaks outside of your lunch break. Hardest part of the job is starting out.  You have to build your own book of business and you do that by contacting friends and family to talk about money and see if you can help them or sell them something.  This always felt awkward to me and I didn\\'t like it.  Everyone there was very nice and wanted to help me succeed.  Not a lot of useful training Working in the field is great if you have the right boss. Opportunities for pay increase and promotion are limited in the field dependent on the size and scope of the practice. I love working at Northwestern Mutual. It was a great place to start my career, however I have reached the top and need to make a change. I learned how to lead people as well as help them succeed Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. If you are about financial services then this is for you, as in intern i learned alot but it was not going to be a career for me. love the idea of work when you want but i had no connections to get started The employers at Northwestern Mutual are kind, gracious, understanding, and give room for advancement. Fast-paced, great learning environment, and focused on community service and customer care. Overall, great place to work if you enjoy administrative type tasks and a focus on organization and problem solving. great company but the commission only based salary for new financial representatives is very hard to live on. I suggest this job only if you have an alternative job. Working for Northwestern Mutual was a real treat, the staff was amazing and the reps there were very helpful while I was conducting my work. Overall an encouraging and helpful work environment. Start day by reviewing client list to email or cold-call. Learned how to effectively sale life-insurance benefits to potential clients. The management was very relaxed and the culture of the office was very easy-going. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people. Northwestern Mutual is one of the best companies to work for on the planet. It has great benefits for everyone and also has great career opportunities. The culture and the work environment are so great. Get ready for the worst experience of your life. Who dreams of growing up and being an insurance salesman? The intern class I took part in was completely duped into believing we\\'d be working in wealth management. Great company to work for must be self started motivated and ready to work hard. Job is commission on and gets tough at times. culture and atmosphere are great Northwestern Mutual is known for their great training program for those looking to get started in the industry or even sales in general. The team I worked with were diverse and always willing to help. The biggest gripe about the place is if you do not have your affairs in order monetarily beforehand, desperation can set in rather quickly when you have a bad month or bad couple of months. Plan accordingly and this could be a great way for someone fresh out of college to build their own business from scratch. The day consists of entering data needed to generate comprehensive financial plans, risk and investment proposals, and other paperwork for financial representatives and advisors. It was a contracting position. Working with the company is a serious win if you are a competitive, sales oriented person. There are great opportunities for advancement, excellent training, and top notch team members. Arrived to a great environment every morning at 7:30 am until 4:30 pm.  Never had to work overtime. I learned how to be a team player, and management had an open door policy.  The hardest part of my job was getting Reps to open emails and respond back before deadlines.  The most enjoyable part was working with great coworkers. Prospecting and calling on individuals to sell financial services products and otherwise help with personal planning. Limited to only selling proprietary products which may not be in the best interest of your clients. The office culture is really great. Management really wants to see you excel in your position and will often hold weekly or monthly meetings to see how you are doing in your position This is a commission based position and requires a certain social personality, sales technique, and persistence to excel. This can be very luctrative to those that put in the work. Say it\\'s your own business, which it is when it comes to traveling out of town for their \"voluntary trips\", but it\\'s not your own business when it comes to time management. Great Culture, awesome people.  Very upbeat atmosphere. ,Encouraging to new employees, unfortunately it was bad timing in my life and I had to leave when I did While the people I worked with were nice, a 100% commission job is extremely stressful.  No leads were given.  Supposed to make 40 - 50 cold calls a day. Northwestern Mutual gives you exactly what you put into it.,They give you the tools to build your own client base.,Nothing more, nothing less.,So far, its been a rather good experience. Low pay rate at the minimum wage for the work that\\'s done daily, repetitive once you know the role back to back.Not a lot of career opportunities.Great training, good people, lots of direct sales experience, fun. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Northwestern Mutual is a firm designed around being an insurance agent and a financial planner. the ones who succeed are the ones that can cold call until the sun sets and have no problem hearing the word \"no\" unlimited times. the atmosphere was fun but stressful, and if you didnt meet your goals you were called out on them. if you wrote policies, you were compensated very well, but if the policy cancelled within 13 months you were required to pay back that compensation. this company provides great financial products and services to clients but does not provide great assistance to its client facing employees. costs as much to work there as you are paid sometimes, Financial work is not something I want to do in my future, but it has not at all made my experience negative.  Great staff, great work environment, great place to advance career if finance is the career for you. A NM representative is challenged with the task of building a holistic financial planning practice by leveraging their personal network and referrals from that network to build a book of business.  It\\'s incredibly challenging and as emotionally exhausting as any sales job I could imagine.  Most reps don\\'t last long, but those who do are stellar professionals and the experience of even attempting it definitely builds character. Internship for a summer. If you enjoy selling life insurance and health insurance then this is the place for you. All commission, employees were friendly/helpful. Learned a lot, independent platform, must be self-motivated, no training is provided, a lot of pressure to sell to family and friends. I would not like to write a review. I would rather not be detailed in my review. I would just like to continue creating my profile without writing a review. A company in search of an identity.  As part on the information technology part of the business, you will be poorly led, over worked and under compensated/valued. If you\\'re employed by a financial advisor rather than the company then you are under his or her payroll/benefits which are entirely up to his/her discretion.You may enjoy working for this company if you have a great working relationship with the representative you work under, but that was not my experience. I worked for a very type A advisor who did not respect boundaries or a work/life balance, who criticized, micromanaged, and would not take ownership unless it was beneficial to leveraging the business. I was under paid and did not receive a fair commission schedule or dental insurance, a 401k was promised but never started. I made some connections in the office but did not enjoy the office culture mainly because of the passive aggressive attitudes and felt very isolated most of the time. There is no efficient on-site training program to acclimate you to the role and you are likely to get several different answers to the same question when calling to the home office for support. Woman dominated culture. They look after their own. ,Many layoffs while building huge skyscraper in downtown Milwaukee.,Once they peg you for layoff they put you on warning, terminate you and fight your unemployment saying you were fired for cause. Its a Insurance company and a market leader. Very good learning experience. Very good Management. You learn the difference of management when you work here for some time. good work environment, very supportive. very stressful days when you don\\'t know where your next paycheck is coming from. I learned a lot about sales and how to effectively explain the products you are presenting and why. I started as a Post-Graduate Intern, and progressed through the program.  I truly enjoy working here!  As long as one is willing to put in the time and effort, he/she/they will have a great time.  It is unfortunate that some reps do not have the market that is interested in purchasing insurance (or have their accounts reviewed). Keep working hard until the hard deadlines come. You go into the office and get asked to put together a list specifically with a certain income range. after bringing in the list they ask you to start calling these people to talk about financial planning. It was a good experience to learn about financial planning but ultimately there was poor management. Weekly meetings with upper management (3), prospecting, and cold-calling are required.  You can make as much as you want if you are willing to work hard.  70+ hours a week at least. I did not receive any benefits from Northwestern and I felt I was thrown into a team with many issues.  They all split up within less than six months.  I was hired to help the new recruits and they quit because of the treatment of them which put me in an uncomfortable position. A great company to start financial planning business. The people are very friendly and are always open to provide all the support they can to ensure you succeed. The training and coaching to great. The hardest part of the job is that its 100% commission. You earn nothing at the end of each pay period if no clients signs up. The most enjoyable part of the job is you work with awesome great people. Productive company where you\\'ll definitely learn allot. The senior advisors are actually really good at what they do but the culture is  toxic. Its all about life insurance. This is a tough career and not something for everyone.  You are truly running your own business and nothing is guaranteed.  Can be a great career long-term. Overall great place to work. A busy office must be able to multi task and prioritize task. Everyone is super friendly and open to help you with anything that you\\'re unsure of. If you are looking for the best sales training NorthWestern Mutual 100% provides top notch sales program.,Very enthusiastic sales force, always someone around to lead you in the right direction.,Competitive.. most interns aren\\'t ready to enter the fast paced environment,,Many meetings and group activities that seem annoying at first, but ultimately prepare you for positive social skills.,Self motivation is key and be prepared to interview and clientele pool you friends and family. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Very slow paced.,It is a very long road to advance in the company the expectation is to make several lateral moves before you move up.,I found the environment very boring One of the few places in my career that I enjoyed going to work every day.  The managers had high work standards but at the same time fun to work for.  I could organise my workload, without being micromanaged.  I could always rely on a team member when needed help.  Most importantly it was an environment where I was appreciated for my input and valued for the contribution I made to the firm. You are your own boss so if you aren\\'t self driven or if you need to have a person telling you what to do this is not the job for you. The company is great and so are the people. Its a Work Hard then play Hard type of place to work. Its the place where one would work hard Monday thru Friday and some Fridays becomes more relaxed than other. Changing considerably where the company was 20 years ago.  Company has focus to go in new direction- from Waterfall dev to Agile/Lean/Safe dev.   Flattened out  management structure and released employees for the first time recently in its 150+ year history.  Employees are given tools you need to complete work accordingly.  Overall, would say company is good place to work. Worked two temporary positions with Manpower at NM.  I was promised temp to perm.  Both contracts lasted longer than a year.  Management made promises that they couldn\\'t honor. This internship was a great experience for me. It help be build confidence in customer relations and I always felt fully prepared when meeting with potential clients. A very structured environment to work in.  A very corporate feeling in the workplace.  no real on-boarding program that would have helped immeasurabley A commission-based position. No salary nor work schedule. This job requires one to produce results using their time and place of choice. One is not paid by how many hours worked, but by the amount of business submitted. Northwestern is a great company to work.  It can be difficult growing an insurance business; however the rewards and money are outstanding if you stick with it.  This is a very well run company. Great place to work but only have a 75 % retention rate as it is 100 % commission and you have to bring your own warm market so you are essentially selling to your friends and family and you get referrals from them. While it seems easy, calling your warm market is very difficult since you know them already and money is a very sensitive subject. Be prepared to make calls to people you know with the end goal of selling life insurance. Can make a good career out of it but it is hard to succeed unless you give 100%. Wonderful and supportive environment.  It is fast paced and high energy.  The benefits for certain employees is severely lacking.  This is why I have to look elsewhere. Project lifecycle and outcomes are rapidly moving from traditional Waterfall to Agile/Scrum.  Many great opportunities to learn, grow, and take on new and exciting opportunities exist as a result.,Company vision for the future is to become the center of their clients lives (or as close as possible).  They are modeling their approach after market leaders both from within their business segment as well as outside of that segment.  The primary goal is to make everything more easily available and the information provided extremely straight forward.,With this future goal in mind, changes to company structure, culture and delivery approach have been necessary to yield the best near and long-term outcomes. The company tell it how it is.  They will not make up ideas about what the workplace is like.  It is essentially a Sales job and you have the the ability to help people achieve financial success as well as make good money for yourself. Have amazing people working at Northwestern Mutual, simply just not the job for me. It takes a special kind of person to continually grind day in and day out without a guaranteed paycheck. Everyone at this company truly cares about their clients.  Such a big company but still has that friendly atmosphere.  NM is an amazing place to work. No one should pass up the opportunity Large management looking for high volume interns and recruits to increase pool of \"warm leads\" and call base. Managers were more worried about their own sales than teaching the new prospects. Was a fun and tough job; ran cost basisis analysis for client\\'s portfolio holdings; would conduct financial and insurance anaysis with clients to fund retirement, etc.; ran reports showing how client\\'s portfolio holdings fared against the S&P 500 index I enjoyed my time but dont see myself returning.  My bosses were encouraging and kind. My fellow co workers were very competitive. I learned a lot and had a good time. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. typical day: boring ,what I learned: nothing ,management: pressuring ,workplace culture: cut throat? ,Hardest part: selling insurances,the most enjoyable part of this job: nothing Not a bad place to work. Business was slow.  I never got the training that was promised at hire.  Never provided work handbook to know what was expected. Northwestern Mutual was a great place to develop. As a financial services professional, I would recommend this as a stepping stone to anyone\\'s career. workplace culture changed dramatically in past couple of years and became a more stressfull place to work. benefits are good but job security not what it used to be Responsibilities included answering calls providing exceptional care to clients regarding upcoming premium increases and offering guidance on product changes and general product inquiries. The company itself is great but trying to move to another area due to extremely poor management is difficult.   Tried working with HR to transfer was a nightmare.  They were very unhelpful.  No mentors are available.,Want out of my dept due to incompetence but can\\'t seem to move and HR is not willing to help but knows about the issues.   Sad.... Northwestern Mutual has a great process that Interns go through to be on the right track to help people with their financial success.  You call a lot of people every day to get business. A typical day starts at 8 am, I typically dial and converse with current and potential clients throughout the day. I hold at least 2-3 meetings with a joint work partner and a potential client and discuss ways of financial planning. This is a perfect place to learn go and advance. Many dreams can come true. Plenty room for growth. Opportunities for advance education always present themselves. Just put your head down and work. Productive work environment with a emphasis on creating a clientele and to fulfill the customers needs financially. Great company with great leaders. 8/10. You\\'ll either make it or learn from it. Worth a shot. The best thing you\\'ll learn is about yourself personally and professionally. Experience is worth every second but compensation...you\\'ll either be extremely happy or extremely poor. This was a co-op position through my high school. My bosses were kind and took time to train and teach me skills I could use. This was a great company that really took care of it\\'s employees. Everyone seemed very happy here. A typical day at work is making 50 dials a day to set up meetings with prospects. The day also includes meeting with prospects and giving them a presentation on how to reach their goal of finding financial security. great work atmosphere,great team mates and managers,Agile methodologies,Process well thought out,Continuous improvement,new ideas welcomed,Trusted by management to do your job and make decisions. A typical day was very demanding. Working in the application input department it was very difficult to find my role and where I fit as an employee. I was pushed around and not rally lifted up in times I needed to be. They focused more on what I was doing wrong which was not a bother to me at all until it became an everyday thing. I was a marketing consultant -- a SAS Programmer/Analyst \" embedded\" in the Marketing Department (as opposed to being in the IS Department). I was a contractor for 3 years.,My experience was positive, and I enjoyed my work and my workmates.There was no defined end to the contract, but it was extended several times. I was saddened to learn that the company\\'s downsizing and cost reduction measures would end up including the termination of my contract. That\\'s how much I liked working with the people in the Marketing Department and especially my teammates on the analytics team. NM takes the employee into consideration most of the time.  Great opportunities to advance once you get hired, but that is the hard part.  Managers are held accountable to give you a review each year and create a career path that you are held accountable to follow. The internship was somewhat beneficial, but when you transition to financial representative; then be prepared to call on everyone you know and everyone that they know. They push you to sell products that people don\\'t need, quite an experience. Honestly, if I could go in and just socialize that would be great. The financial world is not my cup of my tea, but the team at NWM always made it fun. I got close with most people within a year. We were like one big family. I was excited about the opportunity of working for a Fortune 100 company. The sales training I received was 5 star. My day to day activities, were to make a minimum of 50 calls per day, and set 5 appointments per day. At these appointments, I would brainstorm on what the person wants personally, professionally, and financially; then provide them with the proper tools to help them get there. The hardest part of the job was setting appointments, and getting assistance from the organization. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Make sure you understanding the insurance business. If you do not have a natural market to rely on in the beginning, you need to make sure you have funds to last for at least months to pay your bills. If you don\\'t mind living on little to no pay to begin your career, you can make it. The reason I didn\\'t last, was because my natural market was small and my bills added up fast. Now, I could have taken out a loan to survive for a few months, but my wife and I don\\'t want to go further into debt right now. We are trying to get out. ,Management is very old school and slow to adapt. The most enjoyable part of this job is that you are helping people. Like in any business you have to have people to be in front of or you won\\'t last. Great workplace to learn and grow as an individual. Ability to work with many different types of people and help them through reach their financial goals. The hours can be long but the day is what you make of it. Worked as a student intern during college. Decent atmosphere, had to get licensed to sell insurance which isn\\'t as hard as you think. I felt like they used me solely for my contacts. During my internship at Northwestern Mutual over the spring 2017 semester, I was able to build a network and interact with clients and other students on a daily basis. Working closely under the recruiting director, I was able to be her right hand while representing and advertising the company. I enjoyed working in a professional setting and feeling like I was part of the team and not just an intern. I loved that I was included in both work and out of office activities. Everybody was friendly and willing to help when it was needed. I was given tasks that full time employees perform and I loved the challenge. My average work day at Northwestern Mutual was from 6 AM to 7 PM, including most Saturdays. My position was based on full commission with little knowledge of the service I was selling. My position also provided only three weeks of training. After training I mainly focused on building my clientele from the ground up. If I didn\\'t have any clientele, I didn\\'t receive income. There was hardly any management or guidance throughout the work day. I was mostly on my own with no set schedule. Low income, straight commission and no set working hours were the hardest part of the job. Companionship and teamwork with my co-workers was the most enjoyable part of the job. Currently I am positioned as a Financial Representative Assistant which includes creating Life and Disability applications, running ledgers and reports for client meetings, answering phones, prepping PDA\\'s and policy packets to be mailed or hand delivered along with other office type duties. The workplace is supportive for the purpose of any new hire.  The learning curves are steady and the location is nice.  Rent is expensive in the Los Angeles area, and the commute from my location is iffy at best. I personally did not fit well with this company.  I was a recruiter, but it felt very \"salesy\" to me.  Each day was different, but that kept it exciting. Very collaborative work place. Worked in a fast paced environment. Had to adopt an agile mindset as how work is being done is maturing. Good work/life balance. Job is primarily insurance sales with a little bit of finance. Definitely would consider it more of a sales job, but it was fulfilling to help people plan for their financial future. You must be able to conduct cold calls in order to generate business. It is a requirement to get licensed in order to expand your business. One should be open to networking in order to grow their contact list. Trained and developed my skills as a sales agent with the company. Worked in the insurance field selling life insurance, met with clients to renew and purchase life insurance. Great environment and amazing people. Their products were second to none and you were compensated well. The main issue was it was all commission and as a young individual starting out it was challenging not having a consistent base pay. I learned several great skills and techniques for working for yourself. This position was commission based in a very competitive environment. I am forever grateful for the opportunity. If you want to call yourself a financial advisor, expect to really earn it.  They don\\'t give you clients.  You have to find your own.  While it isn\\'t easy, it\\'s rewarding. I loved my management and my team.  I just felt as if, it was a pyramid  scheme.  Everyone at the top is making beaucoup bucks, and the financial reps aren\\'t making anything other than the 4k we received for training.  It\\'s solely commission.  Training is long, and you\\'re thrown into it without much guidance.  Great people, although not a great experience and not worth the time and effort unless you\\'re SURE this is for you.  Feel as if I wasted so much of my time. Leadership is very organized and recognize their employees daily. If you work hard at this company, you will do very well early on in your career. Also, best work/life balance around! Conducted development meetings once a week with interns going over a specific area or skill set of risk management in financial planning. Coach interns enhancing their sales techniques and \\t\\t\\t\\t     knowledge of financial services. Recruit students for interviews on college campuses. Develop and strengthen valuable relationships with faculty, administrators, and student  leaders on campuses. Northwestern Mutual is a great company. My overall experience there wasn\\'t the best. It definitely feels very clique like. The turnaround is high because it is a difficult career, however, every one\\'s experience is different. ,I would not discourage anyone from working there. ,I just didn\\'t feel part of a team and when my needs couldn\\'t be met, it just made me realize it\\'s not their fault. They are a company who is growing and hopefully they will learn from their own experiences from losing great advisers, on how to not be so black and white. My advice would be to offer a middle ground for those advisers looking to still do the work of building long lasting relationships and helping their clients and not necessarily as business owners, but teaming them up ,with other advisers who are looking to grow their team and add value to their clients. ,Your agents/advisers are losing potential team members. The average cost to train an employee is $15,000. Reach out to them first before letting them go to the competition! World class organization. Hires top-notch individuals. Those who are self-motivated will be in the top percent earnings. Northwestern Mutual has been around for 161 years, their training and research-based coaching is incomparable. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. This is a great place to work to get started and learn the financial services industry.,One can be expected to learn quickly on the job and be able to perform consistently at a high level. This is a company you work for in order to build your resume, not to stay long-term. The jobs there are fully dependent on your personal network, which gets exhausted quickly. If you get hired as financial representative you should go in with the awareness that all of the work you put into it is what you get out. You have to have a lot of self-motivation and accountability as well as an organized schedule. You are basically your own entrepreneur which means no cap with how much you can earn as well as how much you can lose as well. Overall it is a good experience for creating skills for work life balance! NM offers great benefits and good people to work with. The company has good advancement opportunities and can be a fast paced and competitive work environment at times. Its commission based but you are your own boss. Great company to work for. You must be an entrepreneurial thinker to appreciate this. Make sure you get All information on sales process and commission payouts up front I enjoyed working my time at NM you have to be committed and in a HEALTHY financial place to survive, but a very rewarding career . The corporate culture focuses on inclusion and the commission-based compensation helps to push individuals to do their best and continuously work on themselves. Glorified insurance salesmen. You will work your butt off for little compensation. You will basically sell insurance products for the first year to all friends and family before leaving. Statistically 16% of representatives make it past the first year. Must try to sell insurance within your network first, then cold call people after. Are willing to train you and sponsor you for your certifications which is a plus. I enjoyed the location which was located in Downtown Miami. I learned to interact with different professionals. I learned to file. I learned new skills with Microsoft Excel. i got licesed and worked in newburgh and this was while i was a sophmore.  this was a good experience met a lot of people and got my foot in the door.  learned how to cold call I can not limit myself to their product and I ended up selling very few policies because of this. I refuse to take the chance that the service I\\'m providing the people I care for is subpar. Excellent work environment with supportive co workers. very hard industry to make it in but if you can build a good client base, you can succeed in this business. Large company, change does move slowly.  Rapid organization change in the last few years. The people that work at NM are the best part about working there. I learned how to interact with potential clients and how to properly assist them with their financial needs. The hardest part for me was getting people to sit down with me and talk about their financials. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with your own schedule. Whenever I had time, that\\'s when I worked. I didn\\'t have a set schedule everyday. It is extremely hard work. It takes a lot of dedication and determination, and is extremely rewarding. Being able to help people sleep better at night is fantastic. You build life long relationships. It was my first Job out of college and it was alright. They end up training you to sell products to people that may not need them so you can hit sales goals and make a paycheck The best thing about working their was my supervisor. She never judge me regarding my color. I loved my job. I just hated working there. There was only one person that make my life miserable. Great opportunity to make a career in financial sales. Take control of your own schedule and learn more about financial services and products. A good career choice for those with excellent speaking skills. Northwestern Mutual provides the opportunity to control your own destination. You control your practice as an individual business, with complete flexibility. Must be prepared to hunt and work hard, but if done right can be extremely rewarding. Great place to work. Local office support team was great. Local management varies from agency to agency with no standard from the home office which can be frustrating. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. This career as a financial planner is what you make it. This requires a lot of cold calling and networking. Selling life insurance or wealth management can be very hard. You will be required to get multiple license. Need to be able to stick it out. They are not holistic planners. They just want to sell Life Insurance products to clients. It you can\\'t get on board with pushing life insurance it\\'s not the company for you. They do not care for their agents and my agent was making more money and they company wanted more of my agents cut. He refused so they let him go. They are a greedy company. I would not recommend this company. Great place to get your feet wet in the industry with a great name in the business. It definitely is not for everyone. Everyone is really supportive and has a lively personality. This is a very difficult job and environment.  It was a good experience and can be very rewarding for the right person both personally and financially. it is a sales job, but you can make your own schedule, risk management focus. Must be disciplined in order to succeed. Decent culture, help each other out for the most part. Good to work with Northwestern Mutual.Lot of good working knowledge and work culture is excellent here.,Able to do to good onshore offshore coordination NW does a great job with their management. They select people that have an incredible amount of experience and the emotional intelligence to challenge and encourage you. This was a typical insurance and investment small office. The daily  office tasks, taking phone call, setting appointments, data entry, process the mail . Great job, great managers, you HAVE to have a large personal network for you to really get off the ground. Otherwise its a very long hard struggle. Loved working there, just don\\'t have the network to support this kind of business. Great experience that gave me some great connections in the field of insurance. It gave me a sense of what I wanted if I was to get into the sales field. I have learned a lot from Northwestern Mutual  The importance of distributing accurate projects and meeting deadlines,  I have worked at Northwestern Mutual for a year and has obtained additional and advanced duties and knowledge. As a contractor, i was accepted as one of the employees. I was treated the great respect.,I would recommend Northwestern Mutual to everyone.,Great place to work. This is a unique job in that you work directly for a Financial Representative. There is a major corporate structure for support, but the advantage of a mom & pop element because your employment is direct. This can also be a disadvantage. I was fortunate to have a positive relationship with each Advisor who employed me. I learned an enormous amount as I was hired with zero knowledge of the Financial Industry. Not only did I become FL 2-15 licensed, but I made sure that I learned every detail that I could through my Advisor, client interactions, Industry documents and presentations. Associate Financial Representative is a great job for those who have integrity, passion for people and attention to detail. The workplace culture has a strong family element. The job requires multi-tasking, self-motivation, high levels of responsibility and a keen sense of management. The role I had was particularly demanding as I supported one of the top 50 Advisors in the nation. While the job has reliable elements that must occur in order to be successful, the daily work has spontaneity and the benefits of change. The most challenging element is also the most enjoyable aspect of the job: working with clients. Customer Service is loaded with unpredictability and a high level of demand. This creates a challenge that not all people can manage. For me it is the most favorable element because I absolutely love people. What I liked most over 27 years is the products themselves were the best in class.    No tricks no gimmicks that would ultimately underperform,Just plain great long term products This job has allowed me to have a great work life balance. They are very good at selling you on the job. It has lots of great benefits but it can be along time before pay comes in. Good management team. Flexible with students. Family oriented business culture. Lots of opportunity for advancement. Very nice atmosphere. They do accommodate people with various disabilities to make work as efficient and comfortable as possible. As a College Financial Representative, this internship really gives you a full hands-on experience on what it is like to be a Financial Planner. 100% commission job with little to none other compensation. Great firm that puts their clients before all. With it being 100% commission, at the start it can be very tough to make ends meat. Great culture and vision in a workplace.  ,Getting new reps off the ground needs some work.  There isn\\'t much training on products and process, and much of that is learned on the job by the rep.  Their goal for reps is to just set the meeting and ask for help. Great job, great people, just not for everyone. Can be tough if you don\\'t put time and effort into it. Good job to be secure if you last your first couple years Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Good place to work.  I was in the Spring College Intern Training Program so I was not able to devote as much time and effort to the position had it been my full time job. Good experience. Northwestern Mutual is a great place to grind at.  It will force you to learn about yourself and go after what you want.  This isn\\'t a place for someone who is not willing to be available around the clock. It was  a great job. Mr. Newton and I worked in the office. I enjoyed it.It was a very quiet and relaxing job. I ran errands alot. I enjoyed getting out of the office for a break. Pleasant work culture.  Professional staff.,A typical day at work varies.  ,Learned how to work with people at all levels,workplace culture is good,hardest part of job is not being given opportunities for advancement,most enjoyable was company events Great place to grow personally, professionally, and financially. You will learn a lot about yourself and how you deal with tough situations as well as good situations all the way through. Stressful place to work with poor middle management as well as poor job security that isn\\'t offset by above average pay.   Trying to sell themselves as a digitally leader but its in words only. People here are all here for varying reasons, but one commonality is that they want to positively impact other\\'s lives. It is exciting being at a company where you\\'re in environment where peoples mission is values and mission driven.  Also advisors are constantly working on continuing education and studying for one designation or another. I spent 9 months with NW and learned more than my entire time in school. I would recommend to anyone. If your looking to make an impact in your community and in the lives of friends & family members, this is the company for you. I worked at Northwestern Mutual for 6 months as an intern my last 6 months of college, so I wouldn\\'t consider myself fully qualified to make a review.,I learned a great deal of insurance industry knowledge during my time there and emphasis was placed on training us. For that I am grateful.,Based on my experience I would recommend Northwestern Mutual as an employer. Excellent Company - Top in the field of Insurance Companies.  Terrific client relationships, excellent client service.  Cutting edge in the financial services industry. Great people and great firm to work for. Everyone is very friendly and is willing to help you grow and learn all that you need to learn in order to be successful. The Managers suck with their adherence to the policy and creating policy of their own. But they are good with being consistent in certain job duties such as motivating employees.,The staff are cut-throat but it\\'s a lovable environment. ,It\\'s a place that turns you into a savage. Generally a good place to work however culture has been strained lately by layoffs.  Still offers the famous free lunch and other amenities like credit union, health clinic and gym. An internship with Northwestern Mutual gives you a first hand look at what it is like to full time salesperson. It gives you a chance to try the position out and see if you fit the role. Overall, it was a good learning experience. NM is an okay place to work but, for contract employees their are little benefits and you get put on the back burner for any requests. They are constantly trying to improve their services for their clients. This is a strictly commission job, but it can be very rewarding. The training and leadership is second to none. They truly care about your future, and they will go out of their way to help you out. ,The company gives you the tools to be successful. We all create our own work schedule that fits with what we are trying to accomplish per week. The day consists of meeting with clients and maintaining relationships with current clientele. There is continuous education essential to be a beneficial financial adviser. The management is committed and supportive to the team members associated with the organization. There is a team atmosphere at the office. The most difficult part about the job is traveling to meet clients that may not even show up. At the end of the day it is worth the chance to change a life. Fantastic place to work. I was an intern here and the amount of support here is unmatched. Management truly cared and was wiling to go above and beyond to help you succeed. I would have loved to have made a career with this company. Unfortunately, being a financial advisor was just not for me. Work was busy and varied,Learning new things daily about insurance and working with large remote home office ,Management was flexible and easy to work alongside,Enjoyed learning new industry and working with people I had a great work experience with plenty of opportunities to grow and learn. Excellent benefits, even free lunch. On the negative side I was laid off. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. This job is almost entirely commission based, and you are technically self-employed when working here. You are required to call almost everyone you know and try to sell them life and disability insurance. I wholeheartedly approve of what they sell, however, actually selling it can be discouraging. Average success rate is about ten percent so you will hear no quite often. I enjoyed working on a team and each individual is very committed and helpful. The corporate culture focuses on inclusion and the commission-based compensation helps to push individuals to do their best and continously work on themselves. Start by going through their training program which takes about three weeks. While you\\'re going through the training program you are prospecting through your warm network. After completing the training program you have to either tap into your warm network and gain referrals or hit the phone cold calling. Management depends on which office you work for but are there to help you with language, goals and overcoming obstacles. The company is wonderful. It is a very sales driven environment with a big emphasis on production. Management is responsible and generous. Fun place to work with co-workers being motivating and team oriented. Great company to work for. Unfortunately going through workforce reductions. There are a lot of long term employees that work here. The benefits are very good, especially for long term employees. Definitely a company for you to grow as a person as well as a business-minded individual.,You will definitely leave Northwestern Mutual knowing more about yourself, others, business, also the way that others think and react. Northwestern Mutual Life is one of the most profitable and stable financial services companies in the world.  Milwaukee is not the best location for a Corporate Headquarters, however. Decent place to work, but be prepared to work in a very corporate culture. If that\\'s you\\'re thing, then you may thrive here, but it wasn\\'t for me. The people I met were all pretty nice, but the pay and benefits were meek compared to other places I have worked. This is a career for self starters. You have to be able to create your own business or failure is inevitable. Cold calling and creating a pipeline is a must. Incredible company and advisors with impeccable reputation.,Intense training for client focused relationships and a financial planning process that has been developed and perfected for 60+ years. I gained a ton of experience in this position. Working with young professionals and seeing success unfold in front of you. It really brings out your best. Great benefits, friendly people, wonderful staff, enjoying working in a business causal environment. Access to the health clinic for employees and credit union. Benefits and compensation are terrible.  You pretty much do not work for the corporation but for someone who works for Northwestern who you are an independent employee contracted too.  Computer systems are archaic and morale is bad. The people make everything in a company and at NM the people are great. The people at NM are currently undergoing a lot of change and as a result everyone is a bit concerned Great co-workers that want to help you advance. But you must be willing to put in the time and the initial money to build your business. You must be comfortable with the word NO. I enjoy the work culture at Northwestern Mutual. The company is really good about walking you through all the required paperwork to get set up in their office. In order to succeed in this industry, you must be highly trainable and willing to cold call a lot of people every day. ,Northwestern Mutual is also really good about providing resources to their interns. They gave me a mentor who worked along side me in all my meetings and who also helped me study for my tests. Northwestern Mutual even provides you a study book for the state licensing test at no cost. They even pay for the state Health and Life Insurance test. ,The internship allowed me to learn a lot about life insurance and annuities. ,As for cons in the industry, I was expecting more of a financial planning position, but it turned out to be a sales position. That being said, I learned a lot about setting up meetings with people and how to pitch a sale. Overall strong company. Selling and dealing with insurance just wasnt for me. The company provides a solid foundation for new reps coming in, but you have to love to sell It was not what I expected when initially recruited and told it would be easy for me build a book of business with my sales background.  Regardless, you are at the mercy of whether or not your client is even insurable when they want to apply for protection. Was there for a spring internship. Training is great, learned a lot. HR department is motivating. Mentors spend time to enhance skills. Everyone is calm and fun to work with. I respect the company overall but the individual financial representative I worked for was awful. I was paid pennies compared to the money I made for him. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. This was a fantastic internship that properly prepared their interns to start their own financial consulting business. The great management team and support is what made this internship so supportive and successful. Great place to work, flexible work schedule, great people in the office that are very supportive, ability to get on many different types of projects to get great experience. Good working environment, fully professional. Co-workers are great and very friendly. Will teach at entry level hand to hand. To start career, one of the good companies. It is a very tough job to learn the ins and outs of the business and build clients at the same time.,Great people to work with.  ,Not a job that just anyone can do. Great training program. Management wants everyone to succeed. Very good back office support. Tim Barnhart is an exceptional resource for anyone looking to get into the insurance industry in the Syracuse, NY area. A typical day at work starts early with morning meetings to discuss objectives for the day.  Calling begins shortly after to reach out to customers and advertise financial services.  Management is very straightforward and lets you know what they expect.  Workplace culture is very encouraging and motivating.  The employees are there to coach you, not instruct you.  The job can sometimes get frustrating when not successful with certain clients.  However, the satisfaction from a happy customer who is on the way toward reaching financial stability is well worth the work. You create your own schedule and set appointments to meet clients and discuss goals.  You help create a comprehensive plan and put together recommendations that would address those goals and answer question like: Will my family be taken care no matter what situation we are in? Can I retire? On how much?,Experienced reps are willing to help in all aspects of the job.  The hardest part is building the clientele but in some ways that is the best part.  It is very much a networking job and the best part for me was meeting new people and helping them in a meaningful way. Worked with this company for more than a decade and was NOT part of the workforce laid off (I resigned on my own accord), so this is not a biased review.,Over my time with this company, I was at the forefront of a lot of change and advancement.  Over the years, it seemed to be moving in a great direction.  Leadership was really pushing the envelope, and then Northwestern purchased Learnvest and everything changed.,The company struggled to decide if they were a life insurance company, a technology company or both.  For years they\\'ve been struggling to find the balance and they are dealing with old, archaic systems that are too expensive to recode and now Learnvest has the capability of finally changing that.,Now they\\'re building an expensive building in downtown milwaukee while also laying off much of their IT workforce.  Many people I\\'ve worked with were forced to train their offshore replacement and then sent on their way with a generous severance package.  The group in which I worked was affected drastically, losing as many as 50% of the people I worked with.  They continue to hire and replace those positions, directly contradicting their original message which was \"we are optimizing the work, and as we eliminate unnecessary work, people will be let go\".  The reality is that the people who are still there are now working more and more hours with compensation that is below market rate.,I would avoid Northwestern Mutual right now if you plan to get in to the IT department.  Other areas seem to be doing well, from what I\\'m hearing. COmpany is great if you don\\'t mind pushing your family and friends for leads and being the strong personality required to sell insurance. Very lucrative if successful. I quit when they wanted me to wash their cars if I didn\\'t meet numbers. Northwestern Mutual is a very professional, ethical and compassionate employer. With a long standing reputation and much opportunity for growth, it is a company I value as having in my resume. I enjoyed being apart of the Northwestern Mutual family. The employees are very driven and will always reach their goals. I admired everyones work ethic! A truly lucrative prospective role with potential for financial and career growth with no specific educational background required. Hard work and dedication will get you far. • Ranked nationally in the top 5% of Financial Representatives.,• Evaluated clients’ financial goals and provided feedback to help them achieve their goals.,• Obtained FL 2-15 License for Health, Life, and Variable Annuities. Great company to  work for, Management should be structured  differently. Proper training would help make the company operate in a better manner. Overall nice place to work, if you enjoy interacting with people, northwestern might be perfect for you. Compensation is almost rentirely commission based, if you have an ideal network of family/friends you can do well, but you also need to sell to your family and friends Commission based. Start selling insurance then you move to investments and long term care. Significant amounts of commissions. People in the organization are very willing to help you out. there was no training or support.  Did not have flexibility to life work balance.  Did have wonderful folks in this agency however compensation could have been better The company is great - solid and respectable. It becomes challenging in the field as a support person to an advisor. Being sales people, they are not trained in management so you have to care about your own development and work-life balance or the job could swallow you up.  It also depends on the advisor you work with and if their personality and work ethic matches or balances yours. For most cases, don\\'t count on the advisor to value you enough to really compensate well. The more common attitude is how they can minimize their costs and get by with as little staff as possible. What we do has great purpose - helping people manage their financial lives - but that noble purpose often feels like a marketing slogan in the day-to-day stress of not being in any way the cause of losing a case for the advisor. This company was a stable employer for many years, but recently they have had huge layoffs, so I would be somewhat concerned about their ability to provide security knowing that you can complete your career. One of the things that I loved about  my positions in Recruiting and Human Resources was that no day was ever the same. The best part of my position was meeting people, building relationships and putting together strategies to help everyone succeed with their goals. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. overall this is great company to work for, however the salary is low with no bonuses.  it is a comfortable atmosphere.  work volume can be high at times, multi tasking is a must for this job. NM is a great company for a career as a financial representative/advisor. Keep in mind that all associate positions are not working for NM, but for the employing financial representative/advisor. Some may or may not offer benefits. ,NM offers solid financial planning and investment management for their clients. The group of people I worked with were all top notch. The advisor I worked for always looked for ways to improve his team and to provide a positive work environment. Great place to work, Great Compensation.,Excellent benefits with work life balance.,Management is great to work with,Worked there for over 20 years. You need a little luck and have to work very hard to bank roll the beginning because it has no base salary.  It takes about three years to really see your practice take off. Each branch of Northwestern Mutual is run independently, therefore, my experience at this location will be entirely different than what is experienced in other locations. Very competitive environment. You get what you put into this job. Commission based salary but no cap so you have the potential to make a lot of money if you\\'re willing to put in a lot of time into this. A typical day would consist of working with leaders, training, interviewing and coaching the sales force (financial advisors). I worked closely with the managing directors, managing partner, director of training and the leaders to maintain alignment and deliver support and resources to the sales force. I learned that building trust is about following through, leading by example and genuinely caring about your team. The hardest part of the job is the relentless dedication to clear communication and expectations. When communication breaks down or expectations are not clear its creates uncertainty. Unfortunately, as a leader you must deliver difficult or challenging feedback; I learned as long as the truth is told in a nice manner, you followed through on your word and you truly care about your people, you can maintain respect. My leadership roles have been enjoyable because I\\'ve watched people grow personally and professionally. I\\'ve had the pleasure of building teams and watching them come together to hit high goals. I really enjoyed the internship program and learned a lot. Theres a big difference between an intern an d a full time employee meaning that as an intern you have more help and more teamwork. I enjoyed the experience, but couldn\\'t see myself doing that for the rest of my life. It was great experience in a intern position. Management and the people I worked with were great. The compensation does start getting good until you have been 7-8 year deep in the business. Excellent Organization and great people to work with.  Great work life balance. Focuses on leading edge technology in the insurance industry.  Fun place to work. - A typical day at work includes analyzing the field force to determine productivity,- I\\'ve learned how to effectively display data in Excel by using SQL,-Northwestern Mutual is a workplace that allows you to bring your individuality and uniqueness,-The hardest part of my job teaching myself how to program,- The most enjoyable part of my job is coming into work everyday knowing I\\'m making a difference High pressure on interns with ridiculous deadlines and standards.Combined with high commissions, made financial planning not in the best interest of some clients This is a good company to learn additional work skills. The job is demanding as you are in a commission based sales position. Northwestern Mutual believes in investing in the development of it\\'s statutory employees. The changing of the environment and culture has completely devalued the companies brand as a great place to work, grow and or build a career.  The environment is more job focuses and no longer a place to have a career. This company is very structured and diverse. I learned alot and met a few new people. Working for North Western Mutual has been a great experience and i recommend others to apply. Friendly Environment and Best Experience,I like working here,Good pay,manager is helpful,supervisor is helpful too,The project is ending soon. loved working here and would love to work again Northwestern had no shortage of people willing to chat and get to know you, the culture is overall pretty relaxed for IT with an easy chance to get along with coworkers. Fortunately, each employee sets their own schedule to allow freedom of their own work day. The day consists of meetings in the morning, phoning, and then meetings that one may have scheduled. The rough part is the fact of one having special abilities and confidence to phone everyday, which some lack. The culture of the company truly is Top 10 in the nation, but the success of the job may trump that overtime. false advertising people. NM is a great place to work, but don\\'t be fooled by the hidden pyramid scheme. They make money off of you and any business you bring in! The turnover rate is something like 87% so basically whatever market you bring them they get their cut first and happily avoid mentioning that to you at all! Don\\'t get me wrong, its decently easy work, but the individuals that make it past 5 years have it easy. All they have to do is wait for noobies to come in and give them \"jointwork.\" You\\'ve been warned! If you want to work in the financial arena do it somewhere where its Base + commission. It is a very tough job to do, but can be very rewarding if you are willing to work hard. The bosses work with you but mainly leave you alone and let you do your own thing. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Leadership doesn\\'t seem to be held accountable for the massive layoffs that have been going on for over 1.5 years. NM strives to respect its employees, but it hasn\\'t walked the walk during this situation. A good company with good products but the training is a joke and they know it.  Do not attempt if you do not have at least a year worth of income stashed away and previous experience that provided great training or you will not survive as it is a commission only setup.  The people are friendly if that is any consultation. Really good opportunity but it was not the right fit for me and not the right timing. I enjoyed all the knowledge I gained and it really helped me transition into my next role. I have learned so much about myself and have put myself in many vulnerable situations which has helped me grow as an individual. Can be highly stressful but perfect for driven individuals. Duties surround financial and medical underwriting of disability products for personal & business usage.  In a typical day I review multiple medical records and corporate tax returns for suitability in our line of disability products.,My specific role is to both do the financial & medical reviews, as well as, help coach and train less seasoned underwriters.  Coaching can be one-on-one or via Skype conferences.,The workplace culture is one that is changing rapidly as there are new ways to obtain insurance products these days.  Northwestern Mutual is trying to rapidly change it\\'s culture to fit these varied needs of the public. great for sales development and learning how to prospect and grow your own business / outside sales / responsible for generating your own leads and clientele If you are someone who does not have any prior internship experience, their internship can be a good resume builder. I do not recommenced attempting to make this into a long-term career. It\\'s what you make of it. It can be fun and positive if you work hard. If you slack off you will make no money and be miserable. The management and advisers are great. The training I sought and received was world class.,I have an understanding of building a financial service practice and managing and mentoring others in the industry that is world class as well.,I have a track record of self reliance and the ability to work in an environment where I earn directly from what I have achieved and accomplished.,This lesson in self starting and self reliance has served me well as I have continued my career. This mindset is also useful in the training and mentoring of others.,As is the case with most careers, self enrichment, discipline and desire can overcome weak leadership. Having a focus on the objective and a relentless desire to achieve can overcome many obstacles. ,Such was my experience at Northwestern Mutual. Excellent benefits.  Culture is evolving as a result of LearnVest/NM merger.  Digital transformation uneven so far.  Leadership is learning how to work differently and build new skills to embrace individual contributor autonomy and decision making. The world of wealth management is dominated by men. I have worked closely with our firm to promote the work of the women on our team here and diversify the culture. This is a typical commission only job, so you get what ever you put in. However, training is top notch. You get all the tools you need to be successful and you receive great support when needed. All you need to do is ask. I enjoyed my internship with NorthWestern Mutual. It provided a real insight of what being your own boss and working with clients directly is going to be like. It was at first a little intimidating but with the sales training they put you through it makes it a little less stressful on your first day. The internship and job life there is a result of how much effort you put in and how willing you are to push on during hard times. This is a commission based only if you are financial rep intern. Again, success is determined by you. This company has no integrity. It\\'s not about what you know it\\'s all about who you know. In order to advance to any higher role you must be related to or be friends with someone of a higher holding position. They also don\\'t compensate you for being bilingual. Productive Fun Work Place, great management.  Good work/ life balance.  Helping clients is rewarding. Flexible schedule and weekends available. Learned property management. They are sneaky and deceiving. Training is on the job. Management will smile in your face and then talk about you behind your back. Job is easy, just takes a lot of your day. The culture is very chilled and laid back. Typical day included a morning briefing, followed by phoning and meeting with clients. Your schedule is as flexible as you make it. Management was helpful and always available to give advice or help resolve an issue. This company is in Milwaukee and has a very nice job culture. Loved to work there. ,Free 7 course lunch is given to all employees. ,No Cons as such to report here You bring in your own clients. If that works for you then you will succeed, if not you will not make any money because it is 99% commission. Everyone there is very encouraging and helpful because they know how hard it is. Referrals are key. Great organization for those willing to pick up the phone and try and set meetings with friends and family. That part of the job was a major turn off for me. During the interview process I was told I would be calling on them and I thought nothing of it. After a few sales calls to them though, I realized how much it bothered me personally. Working at NM can be very rewarding down the road, but lasting over one year is the real challenge. Unless you have enough money stock piled to last you a few months, I would never recommend. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Starting this job is a sales role. People are pushing Life Insurance since that is the company\\'s bread and butter. Takes a ton of work and a significant amount of luck to advance to the levels of advisor. Working at Northwestern Mutual taught me the value of helping others with financial plans for future retirement. Also, helping others find the best insurance plans showed me the value of critical thinking and problem solving. The company culture of serving others cannot be beaten. This is also backed by the highest rated insurance company with  multitude of products to fit anyone\\'s need. They treat others with respect and get to know them on a personal level to build a lifelong relationship. Also, the autonomy of your work week allows work-life balance. Northwestern Mutual may provide one of the few internship programs in the United States that allows interns to fully step into the shoes of an advisor and gain full-time position experience. Depending on your capability of having a strong background of potential leads, this may work out for you. otherwise you will find yourself constantly harassing family and friends to buy insurance. However the corporate structure is well designed to teach young and motivated individuals who ultimately want to pursue a career in finance or wealth management. Northwestern Mutual is a changing company.  No longer are they conservative in work style and are making changes to be more cutting edge.  Faster turnaround on project delivery and looking for everyone to work in new ways. The entire IT department was laid off. Terrible company to work for. The lunches were free and delicious which was a perk. The management style is who are you best friends with, not who is the smartest or hardest worker. I did financial planning for clients with the Northwestern Mutual protocol. Would schedule meetings individually, or joint work, depending on the day or week. Excellent company that is focused on their employees.  The job is flexible, but demanding in a fast paced environment.  Great culture, management and people. Until 6 months ago, this was a destination employer with fantastic work life balance, security, and benefits.  It recently changed it\\'s hiring philosophy, laid off hundreds of local employees and replaced them with offshore resources.  The morale is now extremely poor and the environment is unpleasant to work in. During my time with Northwestern Mutual, I experienced a very competitive environment.  However, it was not competitive in the sense that everyone thinks they are better but in the sense that we all pushed each other to do more and be the best we could be. Its a great company to work for. ,They train you and help you with everything you need in the beginning. Great people! Gained valuable experience with customer service call center. Leaving for personal reasons, couldn\\'t speak highly enough about my experience with them. Lots of mentoring, one on one help, plenty of support from co-workers, teamwork based atmosphere. Loved the trainings and learned a lot. this was a good starting point to learn about insurance it also provides the ability to build and do it yourself. no leads straight cold call and network Treated people fairly.  They have a good training program for contractors. Their mentoring program is second to none.  My management team was supportive. I interned here and learned a lot. Now I\\'m just interested in looking for a new job but I\\'m trying to fill up the miminum characters in order to start looking. Worked in the Southpark office. Great workplace, environment, and fellow co-workers! Had a great experience and learned plenty throughout my time there. This job was the perfect blend of work and play. Amazing culture that offers a quick paced and rewarding environment. Requires a self -driven and highly motivated individual who desires a flexible schedule and financial freedom. Day to day, the job entailed seeing people and fighting to see people. If you did that day in and day you, you would be extremely successful at this career. Team work is rewarded. Sales goals are presented every week. Incentives are set the way is hard to make, so company saves money not paying bonuses. Over all is good place to work. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. The people are great to work with, the Hartford office is brand new as of May 2017. The managing director is an extremely intelligent, personable guy that is awesome to work with. The company has some of the best products on the market because of their high dividend rates. Job doesn\\'t compensate well as an intern, it\\'s completely based on commission and a weekly stipend of 100 dollars. This became an issue because I was bad at phoning. The training staff though was outstanding, great group of people. The layoffs and the way NM is changing is unsettling.  The company has entered a new era and many people who think NM is a company to come and retire is long gone. It\\'s a run your own business kind of thing so it offers a super flexible schedule and some great advancement opportunities but you really have to work for them. Working here was a fun and enjoyable time. I enjoyed working with my boss and I felt like I was treated quite fairly. I recommend this workplace to any and all who are interested. Working for northwestern gave me the experience that i had been looking for. There internship helped me understand what i want to do and understood my needs and wants! My experience at northwestern mutual was the best i have ever had,it showed me what corporate america is like and what it takes. being in school studying business administration/communication made me want to strive harder to my goal of working. It was very hard to get hired, but every NM reps proud to be with the company because of the reputation and products for the clients. In NM White Plains, we hang out every month for \"Happy Hour\". It feels like a family, where everyone share not only work problems but also each individual\\'s personal issue. ,Everything has its own price. It\\'s not easy to stay and you have to put your time, effort and a lot of hard work into your job. But if you\\'re willing to do so, you\\'ll always have people in the office help you keep up with this career faster and easier. A typical day at work was spent answering phone calls, completing complex casework and revising/creating standard work procedures.   Northwestern Mutual has taken on CL&I (Continuous Learning & Improvement) within the past four years.  Lean management can be an extremely effective tool; however, id did not feel as if Northwestern Mutual utilized it to it\\'s potential.  Instead of cutting waste, various departments were forced to complete daily, weekly and monthly procedures that added waste to job responsibilities instead of simplifying roles as lean management is intended to .  The best part of Northwestern Mutual were the benefits and co-workers. In order to be an agent for Northwestern Mutual, you must meet quotas. You are a 1099 employee so most of the expenses fall on you, but the support within the business is second to none. Everyday you learn from upper management and those around you. Through my job as an Administrative Assistant at Northwestern Mutual I have become refined my skills to communicate and problem solve as situations occur within the workplace. I have also learned to think on my feet as situations arise quickly. I have also developed skills that enable me to be both a leader and a trustworthy team player This is a difficult industry, but NML works very hard to see that their reps succeed. Great training programs and support from staff. This is a perfect environment for young financial advisors. Overall, great people to work with... hard to develop client once you run out of leads... most leads are family and friends and you pretty much just sell them life and health insurance. I loved my time at Northwestern Mutual. The people there truly were, and still are, like family to me. I felt so comfortable there from day one. I highly recommend this place to people with strong Administrative Professional skills who like a good challenge and a big splash of fun on a regular basis. not a great place to work. no salary. only comission. offered a full time job but declined. did not learn anything. spent way too much time studying and passing the insurance test Northwestern Mutual is a reputable company with a well-known brand and strong financial backing. The financial representative role allows you to grow and run your own financial practice, helping your clients achieve their financial goals. The flexibility of the job requires someone who is a self-starter, disciplined, and highly motivated It is an exciting experience to know that the work you do for Northwestern matters in peoples lives. My whole life I was so used to doing academic work and to get introduced into the financial services industry through Northwestern Mutual was a great opportunity because the work I did mattered. Even those who did not buy defensive investment products from me, they will remember the Northwestern Mutual name and hopefully remember the positive experience they had working with me. No appreciation for hard workers, favoritism is very prevalent. This makes for a stressful work environment no matter how much effort you give. The work is tedious and training minimal. Work/Life balance is great. You are surrounded by great people. Was challenging because the commissions were so up and down. However, I really believe in this company and what they stand for. It is difficult to get hired on full time to the company but they have a good culture there and benefits are great as well included free lunch every day.  The pay isn\\'t the best but could easily be obtained after putting in some time there Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. I enjoyed working with such talented people whom I learned a lot from during the course of my career. The facility is setup nicely for team collaboration and offers touch-down offices for commuters from other campus. I also enjoyed the flexibility of being able to work from home when needed. I typically was working on the digital filling system, this included any important client information or insurance policies. The workplace environment was professional, yet created a friendly and fun place to work. Love jamba. Once jamba juice, always jamba juice. Usually the quality of hire at jamba is pretty good. Often people moved onto starbucks or to bartending. Worked with them as an intern in college as a part of my graduation requirements. Intern program was pretty good experience but compensated very little. Often would find it cost more to commute for appointments and to the office than i would make per week in sales and income. Established agents with more experience do pretty good because their product is solid but the start your book of business by selling to your friends and family is tough for young people. Northwestern Mutual is a very challenging place to work. Being out of your comfort zone is a challenging, yet rewarding experience. The products NWM offers are excellent. Compensation is usually very low considering the work that is expected. Reps are the most important and any other employees go unappreciated. There is little to no room for advancement. it is okay. the management team does a great job recruiting. doesn\\'t do a good job with giving complete information about the compensation as far as training pay and commission afterwards. At Northwestern Mutual, expect to really work outside of your comfort zone. The internship was very sales oriented and you are essentially building your own business from the start of the first day. Management and other financial advisers were always willing to help and facilitate in any business needs. Upper management can be extremely nasty to employees.,The field has high turnover and most financial advisers and recruiters do not last more than a year. I get to utilize my professional talents in an atmosphere that challenges me intellectually and helps the community at-large. At the end of the day, I leave work feeling fulfilled; like I made a real impact on the community and was appreciated by the company for my contribution. Overall, I can say that the work environment was very fulfilling.  All of my coworkers were very encouraging and supportive which made it a great place to work at. Spent 20+ years at NM and enjoyed wonderful career development with top-notch employees and culture.  In past couple years there has been a dramatic change in the work environment with introduction of Scrum, SAFe, Agile methodologies.  This caused a lot of ambiguity and uncertainty.,Massive lay-offs and the threat of continued lay-offs has eliminated the job security employees formerly enjoyed. Company culture is no longer what it used to be. You are your own boss. You decided how many hours you work per week as long as you make your quota. Very relaxed environment, a lot of calling and meeting clients. They sell you a dream and don\\'t train you on basics. had a bad experience at a good overall company but culture and management sucks and they have these trips that you have to go to that come out your own pocket. Gained a greater understanding of the life insurance and investment professions from the inside.  Was given opportunities to work in different areas and departments. NM is reinventing itself to attract millennials. The new Tower is specifically designed to draw a young, hip workforce to Milwaukee. If you don\\'t fit that profile, search the Milwaukee Business Journal for current news on this company before applying. sell your heartn out selling insurnce sell lots call lots mostly cold call never warm unless you dont care you are shaing your warm circle but whatever if you want money its a place where you learn on your feet and have constant training. commission based position so you arent into the grind with a hustle mentality you will not survive. unless you have rich family and friends Change to a \"software company\" and utilizing greater amounts of offshore/contract resources is shrinking the IT area.  A smaller amount of NM IT employees will have fun with the new NM.  The company is reasonably healthy as evidenced by the large construction investments being done.  If you fit into something that excites you at NM and want to spend a few years at it and then move on, that will work, but it isn\\'t a place to spend a career with anymore for many.  Facilities, amenities, and many people are top notch making it a fun place to work most of the time. Fun, fast pace work environment that is structured to help you achieve your true potential. Everyday brings a new challenge that you work with great people to find a solution. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. If you enjoy hard work, putting yourself out there and a competitive atmosphere this is the place for you. If you have trouble working outside you comfort zone not the place for you. NM offers many training class sessions to help you as a new employee to get on board quickly. You get a great work/life balance here. You can easily network with other employees in and out of your own team. They have great benefits, organizations, and volunteering opportunities. Best thing I love about NM is their Annual Meeting in the summer! Industry leading provider in life and health insurance. Great opportunities for economical and career growth for the right person(s). Lacking in a substantially acceptable training program. More of a throw everything at the wall and see what sticks mentality. The people that I had the pleasure of working with at Northwestern Mutual Insurance and Finance company were some of the most genuine, hard working, down to earth and really intelligent people I have met. A typical day can be very busy and fast paced however the staff is full of helpful people to help as much as they can. They have several meetings in Los Angeles and they are helping with any sort of case. The principals I worked for were GREAT.  However, you didn\\'t actually report to the people you were working for, there was a third party as a manager.  NM also, was letting go of nearly 1,0000 employees replacing them with contract employees and employees with visas and green cards.  This to me expresses a disvalue for their employees. Lacks leadership in every level. Hard to get a solid foundation set. Not for everyone. Good learning experience. Learn valuable life lessons and skills. All they want is your natural market, inability to develop young talent. Or they have the ability and just don\\'t want to develop you. They care more about getting your business in the hands of the company top producers. Working at Northwestern Mutual will teach you all sorts of skills that will be very useful to you in the work world. I learned to to become more comfortable in meetings and presenting to clients. it also helps you learn how to think fast and work hard for a better pay off. Build your whole business off of people that are close to you. Only way to grow is to use a referral system. ,Have lists of names and numbers to call, and try and sell insurance and financial products too. ,Management should be looking to be more helpful instead of taking advantage of new reps. I would meet with mentors once a week. Otherwise it was all of my own work and I had to call my own references. They do not provide you with leads. You have to call people that you know. I was employed by one of the brokers himself under the umbrella that was NWM.  He was a good guy, they pay your salaries themselves and basically run their own businesses. Uncapped commission is attractive but no base pay or draw. Can be tough to get started. Have to have the right personality and be willing to get there early and stay late. Great place to work as long as you are ok with being a contractor. Pay varies but solid over all from contraxt company with experience. Great management Through the Fast Start program you were pressured to provide names of friends and family to develop and grow your business. Compensation depended on product sales to your warm market, which, often times were the most difficult sales. Hence, building a business was more difficult then they cared to admit. Although management attempted to pair you with those of similar personalities/backgrounds, if you did not have high end customers to sell to, you were overlooked for the required guidance you needed. This made the work environment extremely tense and difficult to enjoy building your career. I learned that you must do your due diligence with this company before making a decision to join them because you will be left to build your business on your own. If you are not properly prepared you will not make it. Atmosphere is very competitive. As one of the few female sales reps in my office, I encountered a great deal of defiance from fellow colleagues. You must have a very thick skin to do this job. The department was stressful with all the \"procedures\" to follow and mico-managing that management did.  High turn over in this particular department. I was an intern for Northwestern Mutual. I enjoyed the flexible hours and the freedom to talk to clients. You definitely have to be motivated to do well. I have had the pleasure of working with Northwestern Mutual for some years now and am always impressed with the company\\'s integrity as well as that of the employees. Can be an exciting place to work as the company works to make itself into a Financial Technology leader.  Transition over the next few years will be challenging as new leadership takes over and the reshapes the work force. The environment is friendly and everyone is well versed on the nature of the business. Truly appreciate my time working in this office and learning something new everyday. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. If you are ok with and good at making cold calls to prospective clients than this may be the right job.  It can be taxing at times to be told no all the time. The company is going through layoffs so not certain about job security, although I would assume if you\\'re being hired now you\\'ll be safe for a while at least. Every day was different. It was a fast paced and learning was continual.,The owner was wonderful but stressed.  I know how to deal with a variety of personalities.,The other workplace personnel were kind and helpful when a situation arose that I needed help with they were there for me.  ,The hardest part of the was we did not do a lot of financial transaction such as: 401K, 529, Investment Planning etc.. ,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the clients and colleagues. •\\tAided clients\\' to understand and reach their goals and visions in order to uncover financial solutions,•\\tEvaluated geographical areas to gather a secure clientele ,•\\tMastered the personalized planning process to provide financial solutions tailored to each client’s needs Management was nice but not my ideal place to work. Insurance business is a difficult sell and being so young did not help your chances when selling to a older crowd A career at Northwestern Mutual is full of great people, challenge, and learning and growth on a weekly basis. If you are going to be a financial representative there is no better place to do it! This company is in a transition due to economic pressures.  It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to know what type of work environment it will have 12 months from now. A great job for someone who can handle sales. It is very tough but there is a lot of support and encouragement to reach goals. I wasn\\'t there long enough to give a great review. The company is great, but this particular office isn\\'t ran the best. There are many improvements that could be made, but they won\\'t be implemented, or are pushed aside. they will have you reach out to all of your friends and family to sell whole life insurance policies. this company did very well at training for sales and motivating employees Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work with great people and a competitive workplace environment. As an intern, you must work but good things will happen if you put in the time. Meeting new clients, helping them achieve financial goals, and putting a plan in place are all very rewarding in this internship. Hard work and self motivation are a must! It is a very stressful but very rewarding internship. The management is amazing and they want to see you succeed. They will push you out of your comfort zone and make you work hard, but you will be rewarded. Good compensation for the amount of work put in. Completely marketing yourself and building your own clients from scratch, extremely difficult but can be rewarding. Environment is positive and motivating and helps as much as they can. Great company to work for. Friendly staff and home office is always there to assist you. Every year we have annual meeting up in Milwaukee, its a great learning opportunity and it\\'s also tons of fun. The job is hard but if you do your best to hit Granum numbers you will be successful.  Everyone is there to support you in your journey, but in the end it is all on you to get the job done. Northwestern Mutual is a great company, especially for a salesperson. I\\'m not in for a career in sales, so it wasn\\'t a fit for me, but they are a great company nevertheless The people that I worked with were very fun but they also did their work very efficiently. When ever I has a question I could ask many people with out hesitation and they would always help and guide me in the right direction. Not a bad place to go to work. The majority of people working love what they do and do it with a passion. The internship itself challenges participants in many different ways and allows them to learn a lot about themselves. They are very set on an antiquated sales method. I worked as an intern and chose not to continue working full time. They ignored my request to work in a non-sales position. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Terrific company that you can potentially make alot of money with, however it isnt for everyone. Must be able to pass your life accident and health test and get your license. The job has alot of freedom however requires you to have a good grasp on your work/life schedule. I enjoyed working for Northwestern Mutual. Its a great opportunity. My time there taught me a lot about people and business. The training was amazing and the management was super helpful. As a Financial Representative Intern, I have the opportunity to work hands on with clients. Having past experience in sales, it is of great pleasure to say that at Northwestern Mutual I am not selling, I am financially securing individuals and their families. Don\\'t be fooled. This internship is a sales job. Be aware that you have to use your personal connections for your own client base. If your ok with that then you should have no problems with working here. Northwestern Mutual culture is extremely warm and welcoming. They provide world class training to help their representatives perform to the best of their abilities. Internship program is based solely on whether or not your willing to make sales to family and friends. Management was not very helpful. As far as internships go I would recommend another, especially if there is a real training program involved that allows you to develop more as a professional. A typical day at work is coming in to check email in the morning,then following up with the managing director on daily tasks. I learned to mature and gained more experience in insurance and finance. The culture in the workplace was very close, but there were many cliques. Hardest park of the job was the clearness of tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people. Northwestern mutual was a great place to work where I was able to gain a lot of experience as well as test drive what a career in recruiting would look like. Company and atmosphere was great.  Training on all aspects was incredible.   Sales career was a challenge due to income.  You needed to be incredible at sales to survive. The internship program is hit or miss. I was not aware of the licensing test when I started, which is very difficult and you don\\'t get paid until it\\'s passed. I thought it was great experience and I met some great friends and had good networking as well as learned some very valuable life lessons. I think it can be a good place to start your career. Northwestern mutual offered a friendly productive work culture. Northwestern Mutual taught me how to build my own business by working with experienced advisors to effectively prospect and acquire clients.  The hardest part of this job is prospecting. At some point you run out of leads and are forced to either cold call or go business to business. The most enjoyable aspect of this job is the opportunity to change lives. We believe in doing what’s right. This is evident in the way we do business, in how we work with clients, in the values we hold and in the way we’re working together to strengthen local communities. I was an intern at NM for 6 months and could not get into selling life and health insurance, there were a lot of people in the office I worked in who were very successful, but you had to be okay with selling life and health to people. If you have insurance needs or investment needs go to Northwestern Mutual to meet your needs. The financial advisers and their staff are very knowledgeable. This is the review of a former employee who didn\\'t quite make it.  It\\'s the chance of a lifetime.  The training, resources, technology, mentoring, work culture. . . all of it is nigh unbeatable.  I was working nine to ten hour days with a smile on my face.  They give you the best possible chance to succeed on your own terms.  I didn\\'t make it because I wasn\\'t successful at getting my natural market to take action.  That is the key.  All the work is for nothing if you don\\'t get your people to move forward with their financial goals. Overall working at NML, I gained a lot of essential and transferable skills that I will be able to take with me in the future. The work load varies week by week depending on the rep. A typical day consists of following up with underwriting, clients, scheduling appointments, and communicating with the lead financial representative. Work place culture is dry and strict. Hardest part of the job would be cold calling. Most enjoyable would be interacting with the enjoyable clients. A typical day at works involves being on the phone contacting potential and existing clients. This is in order to set up meetings with them to discuss their current financial situation and see if you can provide them with any service or product to improve their situation (whether that is retirement saving, life insurance, etc.). I enjoyed working for the company as a contractor more than I did a permanent employee. The call center is the worst position to work in. You have to pick days for vacation based on seniority and you pick for the next year. Most of the days you can choose off are during the week, rarely any Mondays or Fridays. The probationary period was never explained. If you have to miss work and ask how it affects your employment you never get a straight answer until you\\'ve had \"one too many\" which is when they fire you. I would not recommend the call center to anyone with children because if they get sick and you have to miss work, you may as well start looking for another job. Great Company to work for. Everyone is very helpful and wants to help you work towards achieving your goals. There is also top notch training that prepares you for your position. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. NM is a good company to work for. Job work and life balanced is good. Benefits are good for an employee. I got to learn new thing technologies. Free lunch was of the benefits. As a recruiter intern I work with the main recruiter for the Northwestern Mutual in Norwalk. While interning I learn how to use websites like linkdIn to find individuals that are interested in starting a career at Northwestern Mutual. This is a great company with even better training. This is a Life insurance company therefore you are a life insurance agent. This is a sales job. They will develop the skills you need to transition into a career as a financial Adviser. They give you all the tools to learn and build your career path. They have everything figured out and you just have to follow their system. Great culture and lots of support. I discovered that Northwestern Mutual has a great work environment, the reps and staff were terrific and the products they offer are excellent.   My tenure there was short but I enjoyed learning about the company. This is a great company to work for. My only complaint is the the pay structure. If you are an agent it is commission only, which can make it difficult to start, especially as an entry level. There are plenty of companies that offer a base + commission. Northwestern Mutual Brand in itself is great and powerful. However where the down fall is management. This doesn\\'t fall on NM because technically NM only have 25 employees. If you have a terrible MD then you will NOT be successful in this industry. It\\'s a numbers driven business and they tell you that you are your own boss but that is NOT the truth. You are micromanaged. They tell you all the good things to get you into the door but just like anything that\\'s too good to be true you have to read the fine print I really enjoy the culture at Northwestern Mutual, It truly makes you feel at home. The support from mentors and senior leadership is world class.  Keep it up NWM I did a college internship at Northwestern Mutual. I learned a great deal about the financial industry. Good business, life insurance sales just was not right for me at the current time. To inspire change the company is downsizing.  This has long term cultural effects that are still to be seen.  It has brought uncertainty with long term employees, created confusion on roles and responsibilities, and left many of those still there wondering if the next shoe will drop and feeling uncomfortable.  However, this is a stage in this companies life, a new beginning.  If you can handle the change, and uncertainty for a couple of years, the companies future is stable and has a great sales force.  For now, it makes it difficult to see future opportunities, but they will come...eventually. Northwestern Mutual is a very well run company that values every policyholder in the company. I truly believe they put their policyholders first and every decision is made with them in mind. I enjoyed going through the process of finding out clients goals and then helping them pick out a specific financial plan tailored to their goals. I felt like giving a client adequate life insurance was very beneficial and was the right thing to do to help the client. The downside of Northwestern Mutual was their training wasn\\'t very beneficial and some of the other representatives are resistant to helping you grow and learn. Being a financial rep at Northwestern Mutual is a great job for several reasons. First, the company is trusted and established in the industry. Second, there is a good compensation rate for sales. That being said, the work is hard and is almost 100% sales. One must be comfortable with calling people on the phone, meeting with them, and selling them insurance. Northwestern is a great company that always gives back to their employees. They pay based off commission with a stipend included. The company treats each other like family and you have the freedom to create your own schedule. The future is what you make it. We are in challenging times that require people, at all levels, to think and act differently. When we can align the incredible resources we have we can a force that is truly unstoppable. Unfortunately, sometimes that means cutting away a few strong, but dead branches. It was a great experience. I was introduced to the day to day duties of a full time financial advisor. Northwestern Mutual requires an extensive trainign program for its interns it is usually a 40 hours on boarding. Excellent play to work at with great earning potential, great working environment and its a joy helping people become comfortable financially, great way to start your career after college Very wonderful company, I enjoy the great learning experience I am getting. They care about the clients well being and are always happy to answer any questions. At first I really wanted this internship because it paid decent, it would give me valuable experience, and I wasn\\'t in sales I was in more of a human resource/administrative role, but after a couple months of working there, the work became tedious. Even though they said I did a great job, they never offered me a full time job or contacted me again. Great company to work for.,Advancement opportunities. ,I\\'m learning the value of quality over quantity  while increasing the quantity.,Most enjoyable part of the job is receiving feedback. Northwestern Mutual was a quiet place to work with a good work load. Kept track of my employers Group Health Benefits for local business. I made appointments and handed census to business for quotes. I also made phone calls to clients on age changes and financial reviews. While doing this I managed my own business contacting my own set of clients and helping them create financial stability. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. I\\'ve been with Northwestern Mutual for a few years, I\\'ve learned that the Financial Advisor career is not the right fit for me but I am very glad that I gave it a shot. This role is for the type of person who knows they can build a clientele on their own and who is deeply passionate about doing that. I will always be a client and have built some great friendships throughout my time with them. Northwestern really allows you to learn a lot about what you like in the financial services industry and makes sure to provide you with all the tools you may need. Great people,Great Experience,If you work hard you will do really well,Making 40+ calls a day,Have to meet with 15 people a week to do well,Need to learn about the products the company has to offer They have a good culture but push interns to the limit, if you want to stay you need to put in about twice as much work as another internship. Great experience, and development program. Your day starts whenever you choose to arrive, though the office culture typically stipulates 9:00 am. You get out what you put in, so in essence, if your in early and you\\'re making phone calls and setting up appointments with potential clients it\\'s bound to pay off. Compensation is commission based so it behooves you to put in the work. Northwestern Mutual has been a great company to work for. The office that I work in is full of great people that support your goals and career advancement. The environment is very open and inviting to employees at all stages in their careers. I am always very busy as I help three financial advisors run and operate their businesses, but we have a team oriented atmosphere. We work together in order to achieve our goals. I am a Web/WAS admin in our Command Center. I handle monitoring, incident resolution, and problem investigation for our front end web servers as well as our websphere environment. I feel proud to work for a company that has such a great reputation for how it treats its employees. Spent a lot of time prospecting for clients and trying to set meetings. They have a great model that works if you are able to keep pace with it. Commission structure was tough and fluctuating greatly. Northwestern prepares you with a great training program to help you understand the financial services industry. They really help you understand how to make a sale. Was always able to talk to anyone. People were very easy to talk to. Management was not the best to talk to because they were never around. If I had any questions, I had to ask others that were around me for help or advice about something that I wanted to do. Very good environment with values of taking care of the client\\'s needs.  The company does the right things with each advisor running his/her own business which tends to make it feel more like a smal business in the work environment. The climate of the company is changing significantly, there is a lot of confusion in the team/company.  There has been recent job layoffs which has caused more uncertainty. good at learming at workplace,Northwestern Mutual is revamping its Illustration systems to improve its presentation. The application is used by financial representatives to showcase the benefits of various wealth management/ insurance products. As ,part of this project, NM would provide representatives a modern responsive web & mobile platform that ,illustrates benefits and features of its policies. I work for them in the past and now rejoined because they are the best and they  have the best support in training in the industry  and working together as a team. NMFN is a strong company. They will be sure to tell you about that. More of a life insurance company than a financial services company, but they do have a broad variety of products to sell as a Financial Representative. An amazing opportunity for those who want to work hard and work somewhat independently. This job requires considerable time to ramp up to the position of self reliance. intially there is much traing and oversight as their should be. In a years time I was at the top of my class with lives and premium, but the hours put in were well over forty hours a week. Great company to work for! Has great potential to make a lot of money. But all depends on your network and confidence on asking them for money. Good company overall The work life balance is one sided with this company and the work culture is pretty solitary. Overall I learned a lot by working for this company but would not want my career to be with them. Built a foundation of knowledge in finance, insurance and sales concepts that helped me succeed in providing financial security to clients. Developed a client base and work to build a successful practice, with support from office colleagues and the company. Provided with Real-life experiences while earning performance-based compensation. Vaults top 5 Internship programs 2016. Tough business to get into. This is a commission based business. You have to build your own network of clients and it requires a lot of hours and lead follow up. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. There is no \\'typical day\\'.  Everyday is different, depending on what comes in the door.  Management does not hover, they let you set your own rules, as long as the work gets done.  The hardest part is dealing with so many different Financial Reps and their personalities. Most enjoyable part, helping Reps reach their goas. NWM is a strong company. The financial representative role has unlimited potential for a few. Failure for most. As a candidate they will build an income projection. It will be favorable. Take it with a grain of salt. Do your research. Compare Industry failure rates. If possible gather information on specific district you are a candidate with. Recruiter should be able to tell you. Its a difficult career path. Be prepared to devote long hours with little financial return early. As a contract employee business expenses will be on you. Insurance and misc charges will rack up and will be deducted out of future commission checks. Daily operating expenses will also build up (printer usage). Business model is set up to build book of business off of friends, family, and close network. Prior to pursuing be sure you understand your foothold on your network. You will not succeed if you are unable to 1. produce from your existing network 2. are unable to expand and build diversified network. Maintain high energy level and hit the ground running. Regaining momentum is extremely challenging. You lose traction and you will fail. Do not fall behind on administrative business practices or technology. Difficult to receive clear path(s) forward. Do not wait for someone to get back with you. Must be diligent and hammer shared services and admin all day every day. Love working at Northwestern Mutual.  People working there are highly ethical as well as super smart.  It is a mission driven organization that truly cares about clients and the community. Northwestern Mutual was a nice place to work. The people there were great to work with! There is room for advancement, and the company has many perks and benefits. Wonderful company to work for.  Great compensation and benefits.  The only downside is that the company being located downtown therefore affordable parking is hard to find. Try to pitch the position as finance position. This is 100% cold calling friends and family to try to sell them life insurance. Sales training is solid, I left as soon as the training concluded. I learned that saving for your retirement is important for a youngster like me. Hardest part of the job was being in the office all day. If you have headphones and your favorite tunes the day flys by. Too many things to do in one day, not enough time to get it done. Management does not really seem to care about you. Juggling work load, on phones the entire day, best part of the day is going home. We combine our unsurpassed financial strength, solutions and expertise with time-tested principles, a comprehensive approach to planning and a financial representative’s long-term commitment to listen to, guide and encourage you. A typical work day includes preparation for the day, making a minimum of 40 calls to prospective clients, meeting new people each day, and creating financial plans. Employees will learn how to effectively manage their time and will learn all about finance. Management is helpful and encouraging. Many of the other advisors are approachable and want you to succeed. Depending on location, the culture in the workplace is that everyone wants to be as financially successful as possible, so coming in early and staying late is highly encouraged. The hardest part of the job is overcoming objections and earning referrals. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a positive impact on the lives of your clients, and helping people succeed financially. Learned a lot during my internship not just on the ins and outs of the Financial Services industry, but how to conduct yourself as a professional. Fair work/life balance is good and the technology the company uses is very good. brand new building will make it even better. I learned more in my time at Northwestern Mutual than I believed possible, The speakers I had the privilege of learning and absorbing knowledge from have taught me lessons that will carry me throughout my career. Some departments are great to work in, and others are not depending on the management. The workplace culture is ok depending on what department you are in.  Some of the leaders within the company are down to earth and approachable. The experience was good, but I did not like how you had to call all of your friends and family to make sales. You do learn a lot about the business though. Colorado Springs office had great leadership and helped us interns succeed. I would recommend this company and location to anyone. My day starts with standup and then into the meetings, offshore calls. Team work is highly values in the team,Also deliverables are set for each sprint and are achieved. Overall goal is planned ahead and are coordinated between multiple teams.,Most enjoyable part is the team work and ideas that eveyone brings in. Working at Northwestern Mutual was a total gift because though I moved on in career, my co-workers were the hardest things to leave behind. Our managing partners were all top notch and made sure to know all employees by name and maintain an open-door-policy feel.,The work events were always a blast and the steady comradery made for a super upbeat work day. Lack of advancement is the greatest opportunity for this company. The focus is truly on the financial reps, but staff employee could benefit from training and other developmental opportunities. Great employer with great opportunities! Hard-working colleagues and a large clientele base. A company that is very active in the community and involved in many charity efforts. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. The compensation structure is not ideal. You only make money if you sell policies. A lot of people do not want to be life insurance so it can be really difficult to sell. Our mission is to provide the best possible financial security to every client, every day. My team only feels we\\'ve succeeded when our clients feel compelled to return to us as their financial planning needs grow and change. Even more telling is when our clients recommend their family, friends and colleagues to us to help with their financial planning.,To this end, my team works together to:,Listen first, discovering and uncovering important issues in the present and future.,Employ our knowledge, experience, vision and heartfelt values about what we do, to help create solutions for complex situations.,Advocate for the interests of associated persons, especially those loved ones and employees affected by, but not participating in, decisions we help our clients make.,Help create opportunities for families and business owners to preserve their accomplishments, protect the welfare of their families and increase their character and impact.,Embrace our calling with the same intensity, passion and affection we give to our own families. Great organization, great people!  A leading employer in Milwaukee delivering services to help others during all stages of their lives. Great place to work. Opportunity to work in different technologies if interested.,Management is supportive. Lot of people stay for longer duration and gain domain experience. I love this work place because it gave me a balance between my work and school which I was really grateful for. The benefits are really great, vacations, time off, insurance, retirement, ect they have it all. This is the most enjoyable environment and always honored to be part of it. Amazing insight as to what the position entails. Very professional environment and the team is always willing to take extra time to mentor the newer hires. Work/Life balance is based on you. Production based pay so your hard work will be noticed. New office is really cool, too. -Great coworkers,-Flexible hours,-Commission based,-Job allows you to help people,-Great work environment,-Freedom to build your own business of sorts,-Opportunities for advancement The people I worked with while I was interning there were amazing.  I learned at lot concerning in depth financial plans and interactions with clients.  However, the day to day of constantly calling individuals to try and obtain meetings and later business was not for me.  It is a job that someone needs to do, but that someone will not be me. I\\'ve enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual.  The people are very professional, very well mannered, and at the same time they make it a fun environment for employees. Very productive work environment. We had a fun loving enviroment. Even working conditions were good enough. They really take care of their employees. So it was a condusive environment for everyone. The staff is extremely helpful to all agents and clients.  If you don\\'t mind a racist owner (of the Tampa Bay agency, not the home office), this is a great place to work.  The staff is not a reflection of what the agency owner says behind closed doors. The experience I received through my internship with Northwestern mutual was exceptional, however, it required a lot of time and work. You have to be fully committed to the internship and it has to be your number one priority. The culture is very sales orientated if you like that you\\'ll fit in great. You\\'ll get some insurance certifications and real world experience. If you produce enough you can get investment licenses. If you don\\'t mind working sales and all commission lots of money to be made but it takes quite a while. A lot of phone calls and meeting with clients. If you do not enjoy reaching out to friends and family for business it is not fo you. A typical work day is generally laid back and can be worked around your preferred schedule. Work days are long, beginning at 7 am and lasting until 6 pm or later. There is no salary and is very difficult to get starting fresh out of college with no savings. Tons of cold calling. Management does not help you in any way. Recommend you call your family and friends to sell life insurance to. Extremely difficult to start out. Everyone\\'s experience is different depending on their success. As an intern I received a $100 stipend and received commission based on policies produced. The office culture was fun and relaxing, but your pay check was based on number of policies signed, so to me it was a constant scramble to book meetings and try to have a prospect sign up for Life Insurance.  I learned a lot about the industry, but don\\'t see it as a career because it is mainly sales oriented. Great company to work for. Flexible work arrangement. Senior management are approachable. I have learned a lot about the Private Equity Secondaries Space Northwestern Mutual has a great culture and environment of constant growth and learning. It is certainly one of the best companies in the nation for a reason. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Depending upon your team, you could have a very enjoyable and valuable work experience. Northwestern being the large company it is, has the resources available for you to learn. They pretty much ask you to sell every person you know. You call everyone you know and sell them insurance -- it was a grueling experience overall and I would not recommend it. Great people, great staff.  Excellent company to work for. I love working for this company and would not want to work anywhere else. would start off the day by calling prospective clients. Experience was overall very challenging but also rewarding. You get to have a hands on experience as a life insurance agent. Great place to work but a lot of hard work especially in the first year cause compensation is commission based. The training is fantastic as well. They are there with you all the way to make sure you succeed It\\'s all about relationships and getting referrals. If you put in the time and the work, the results will eventually show. Most other reps are more than willing to help, but at the end of the day, you are running your own business. Working in the Diversity and Inclusion space is not just a job, its a journey. This work not only impacts business, but it impacts lives. Its rewarding and necessary in the world we live in today. It betters our future. They were really eager to train us but when we actually started working it was not that friendly. We learned a lot on our own though which was good in a way. All about activity. Make sure you are seeing as many people as possible. Follow the guidelines and you will succeed. Do not rely on family and friends to help you start because if they are not interested in buying then it can cause relationships to be tested. Great company to work for with focus on clients, prospective clients, community and their employees.  They are family oriented with a number of events throughout the year to encourage personal and professional development. Great place if you are a self-starter and require little direction. work life balance can be difficult if you have a family. Do not take Financial Representative role unless you have at least 6 months of income in the bank to support yourself while you get your business up in rolling. High turnover rate in representatives is not due to company or products but usually personal situations. (financial hardship/lack of work ethic. The company environment was one of the best I have ever experienced. The entire company, from the executive level to the intern level, were always there to lend a helping hand.,Their training staff is second to none. I enjoyed the position. Agent I worked directly with was generous in his understanding of being a single parent with a then small child. Learned about whole life insurance when previous background was universal & variable life, mutual funds & annuities Organizing training meetings, one on one coaching with financial advisers, company reports. Managing under five year financial representatives. Learning culture. Dealing with self discipline with financial advisers. The ability to watch financial advisers grow into a blooming practice. Great job but all commission, perfect for someone with lots of connections and in a stable financial position. You get to run your own business and be your own boss. it was really hard work, But I think what they did is awesome and I have a great deal of respect for any who jumps into that industry. If you\\'ve got what it takes and the network to sell to, this is an absolute dream job. So much money to be made. It takes a while to get started, but once you\\'re rolling, you\\'ll be rolling in it. The management was a dream that was trying to help everyone achieve what they were capable of. A typical day at work would include data entry as a secretary, answering the phones at the desk, and organizing data into appropriate files. I learned how to successfully enter data for a professional company and also learned several computer skills. The workplace culture was a typical business place with cells and different corporate offices. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the speed and accuracy of the data entry process. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people who were benefiting from my work in their workplace. I enjoyed seeing my efforts being used in their work daily. Advisors at Northwestern Mutual go through first class training and are put into position to write their own path. My experience with management has been great. There is very little required time in office or meetings as you are free to create your own schedule and daily schedule. Great environment and a great culture. Very hard business but if you just stick to what they say you will be successful. You must be self motivated. You will hear a million different ways to do things you just have to adopt what works for you. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. I love working at Northwestern Mutual. The staff is welcoming and fun, and everyone is willing to help or take a minute out of their day to talk to you. They give you a lot of flexibility and independence, which I thought it was very relaxed. It is pretty much male-dominant, so working as a female is a little challenging. Great Teams, Great Commission, and the ability to build a very successful career.. I would recommend anyone starting off in finance to explore a career at northwestern mutual. Its a tough business to start out in. But if you stick your head down and do the activity it will workout for you. the one downfall is, is that its strictly commission. With the changing environment at Northwestern Mutual, there is a feeling of uncertainty about job security.  This is a difficult environment to work in and I am being proactive.  I have had multiple opportunities for career growth and development during the last nine years and with the lean processes implemented within the last year my job responsibilities have changed considerably. It was a great opportunity, but you have to be ready to embrace the learning culture in order to make it. If you don\\'t like making phone calls to generate leads then this is not for you.  If you a hustle mentality and are willing to go the extra mile for about 2 years, then you\\'ll do great. Northwestern mutual is one of the big insurance clients in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.,Product owners and the Project managers are very supportive.,** You will get free lunch every day** A typical day was providing support to Sybase databases,  investigating issues that might be caused by data problems, business logic, Informatica mappings, Unix scripts, Sybase or DB2 databases, providing support to other teams that access the aforementioned databases, mentoring other developers by providing any help to them. Good to work in that company very spacious good team members and encouragable manager its a very pleasure to work in that company Have to have own book of business, no help with leads, joint works splitting commission earned, no sharing of JW down,split commission on your leads that you have established Very difficult for a college student to sell complicated financial products to older friends and family. Would recommend but must have a very strong and young network in your area. Great opportunity to make a lot of tips but is extremely fast paced and longer hours as well as being outdoors year-round. Working at Northwestern Mutual was very engaging and fun. I had a very supporting team. Everyone is very friendly and ready to help. Free lunch everyday.:) Great people doing great work to help clients identify and achieve their financial security goals. Proactive strategy, driving innovation to provide the experience people want and deserve.,Unfortunately, contractors are paid so poorly that they cannot achieve financial security for themselves. It is conflicting to work,It is hard to motivate to come to work knowing that the company is so motivated by their Client\\'s financial security, but not concerned with their contracted employees financial security. You basically run your own schedule. With the exception of a Monday and Thursday morning meeting from 7:30 to 8:30 there are really no times you HAVE to be at the office. You run your own hours and practice. The top leadership is hard to get hold of and you have to schedule time to meet with him at least 3 days in advance. Your immediate supervisors are almost always available, and just about any of the advisors are always willing to lend a helping hand.,Hardest part of the job is cold-calling and the fact that there is no set salary. Most enjoyable part Over my past 6 years at Northwestern Mutual, I have had many different and evolving roles.  I learned to be flexible, to multitask, and the ins and outs of financial planning. Internship was by far the hardest of my career. You don\\'t get paid much and you\\'re gonna have to work. Do it if you\\'re genuinely interested in the career of financial advising. Not everyone is treated equal here.  Some areas are fast passed and others more layed back.  You have to prove yourself before you can get any work/life perks. Northwestern Mutual is a premier company with a wealth of knowledge and focus on providing the client with the best services to achieve their long term goals. ,This is a wonderful company to work for and has great benefits. Great company but difficult because it is only compensation based with no base salary.  Otherwise a schedule that fits with anyone. This company is great. I love my managers and my team. They have a direct interest in my well being with the company.,I also love the office setup and vibe. Everyone is super helpful and attentive. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Very tough job for anybody just starting out. 100% commission so if you aren\\'t producing you won\\'t be making any money. It is more of a figure it out as you go job. A very big client in Milwaukee area with thousands of employees.,Northwestern Mutual is one of the big clients who serves free lunch every day for all the employees. Northwester Mutual paid for training and certification. Compensation was fair, but a majority of the job is selling insurance instruments to friends, family, and whomever else in your network. I really enjoyed working for NM. There is a good culture, and everyone gets along. The work is challenging and rewarding. I would definitely recommend for those who are interested in growing in sales. Recruited college prospects who applied or were interested in the financial planning internship. Conducted interviews for candidates. It was okay, learned a great deal, not much room for advancement if you\\'re not a life insurance salesman. I had fun as an intern but grew out of it.  Moved on to bigger things. - unstructured internship training program,- very friendly coworkers and team culture,- typical day: make client presentations on Northwestern Mutual products The company is fantastic and the San Antonio office in particular is incredible. All coworkers are there to help and the boss of the office is a great leader. Helps anyway he can while also ensuring you are on the right track. The position itself is quite difficult and mentally taxing. It\\'s not for everyone, just for people that are highly motivated. Northwestern mutual is an excellent company to work for. If you have the drive and ambition you can go very far with this company. I learned a lot about the financial planning industry and the company has a great culture. NM is a great place to work, only thing that could better is increased base salary and more hands-on training.  The drive to the downtown PGH office can be a hassle day-to-day. This job was also in the Grand Rapids office of Northwestern Mutual. In this position, I worked directly for an individual Financial Representative, and not for the company itself.  With the investment and insurance licenses I hold, I was able to do work with the Financial Reps clients and process any of their request or needs. This allowed the  the representative to have more freedom in his business, and did not always need to be in the office to process client needs. A great group of employees that I worked with for about 15 years. I loved working with the new Financial Representatives and College Interns. In the Financial Field things are always changing, so you are always learning new things, and are required to continue your education. Fantastic opportunity for anyone who is self-motivated and desires their potential to not be limited. You will learn what it really means to be a financial planner, and how to help people reach their personal, professional, and financial goals. Very team orientated, friendly atmosphere, able to work independently & strive for goals as a team.  I would highly recommend him to clients as well.  Loved building his business Team setting, management needs some work (very indecisive with how the work be presented), lacking accountability within team, allows work from home option, minimal face to face training due to work from home option. Its a very cut throat environment, they are looking for a specific type of person and if you do not meet that requirement, then they wont spend their time trying to train you. It\\'s a very good job if you want to work for commission.  The company is very trustworthy and valued.  There is job security.  Co-workers are very valuable to provide support.  ,The hardest part of the job is commission and you don\\'t see your full benefits to make money until about the third year. This is a good company to work for, the people here are willing to help you if you put in the work. The products that the company has to offer are far more competitive than any other life insurance company. great place excellent boss a nice place to work people are friendly and always willing to help....and is very close to home go to work call clients for an hour every day then go to meetings if you can set them.,Learned in depth understanding of life insurance products,management was pushing hard to keep calling, much needed if you enjoy having somebody on your back.. not me,co-workers are just trying to make money like everyone else,hardest part of the job is calling and calling,most enjoyable part is going home each day Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Great people and management from the top down.  Great support system from the corporate office if there are any issues that arise at network offices. Great overall. My experience at Northwestern Mutual has been incredible. A typical day starts at 7:30 and ends around 6:00 or 7:00. The first several hours are spent in the office at production or training meetings and contacting clients as well as prospective clients. The rest of the day is spent working with clients, pitching financial planning ideas, posting your activity for the day, and planning for the following day.,Over a period of 5 months I learned more about personal and corporate financial planning, estate planning, and the markets than I would have learned through years of finance classes. The most important lesson I will take with me from my experience at Northwestern is my new appreciation for listening. The management in the office was very helpful and had decades of experience. I learned to sit back and listen to experienced professionals about life and the industry.,My coworkers were very personable and easy to work with. I felt very welcomed in the office. I was not treated like an intern throughout my entire time with the company. The hardest part of the job is tied to the most enjoyable part of the job. I learned how to deal with \"no\" this summer. It is not easy taking rejection all of the time. I believe it is important to understand you do not get what you want and everyone is not going to like you. The best part of the job was the feeling of success. The intrinsic reward of earning the trust someone with their finances is very special. It was a great feeling to see someone appreciate your knowledge and hard work. ,I gained real professional workplace experience,, knowledge, and a group of friends this summer at Northwestern Mutual. I had a great experience and would recommend the internship to anyone that is serious about financial planning. Great solid company. Lots of benefits and perks if you put in the work and time. 100% commission based salary makes life a little stressful. Requires a ton of networking everyday. Must be comfortable using high pressure sales tactics. You pay all your own taxes, so keep track of your business expenses. Management puts a lot of pressure on you to make sales. The worst part about the job is you will never be able to look at anyone the same way ever again. Everyone you run into will be a potential client for business. Deciphering work relationships and real relationships becomes difficult. Be prepared to put in long hours if you want to be successful (70+ a week). Great starting career for anyone looking to grow personally and professionally. Northwestern Mutual is a fantastic company. They have an excellent corporate structure and really value putting the customer first, which I feel is rare from a company this size a lot of times. As a company I really value their integrity. The only drawback I had while working there is that advisors with NM are only paid on sales commission. This probably works for some people but it takes 3 or 4 months to really get established and I had to leave because I didn\\'t have the ability to wait that long before really making money. Company is growing wish I\\'ll was still employed with Northwestern Mutual.  Great benefits and lots of perks.  Free lunch program, parking or bus pass if you use the bus. Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work for. Our office was awarded best workplace 2016 this year by the Hartford Courant. The opportunities here are limitless. Management helps employees to unlick their potentials I received no salary in this job and was paid strictly commission. With a good warm market any one could be extremely successful when backed by any of the managers that I had. Worked here as an intern. Completely commission based except for a $100 stipend per week. Took over a month to actually make any money. Stressful and unpredictable. Lots of a phone calling and prospecting. You will be expected to call all of your family and friends. In the time that I have worked here, I have enjoyed the environment as well as the employee interaction. Management has always been available and eager to help, I\\'ve learned a lot from them. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the quick pace. This is an all around good place to grow. Fast-paced work with a steep learning curve. Lots of multi-tasking. This is much more than a typical administrative job. Northwestern Mutual Life has a number of great insurance products.  They need to work on developing their training program as the agents  could use additional assistence. awesome internship able to push yourself and receive help from top people in the industry, highly recommended. Awesome coworkers Is a sales and commission job as a financial representative. You are not at a desk all day. Job involves meeting clients and traveling to them. Hardest part is working hard every day pushing yourself. Pay is commission, so if you are not selling you won\\'t have a job for long.  You get to set your schedule mostly. a typical day is meetings, client servicing, development and phone calls. learned much, not the best management co workers are okay hardest part of job is keeping up with everything. It was a good place to work, plenty of opportunity for advancement, good benefits and perks.  Co-workers were great, the work atmosphere was professional and supportive. I did the summer internship during 2016. Their technology is way too outdated and you spend half your time on with tech support. I passed my licensing exam and then it took an extra month for them to sign my contract. The entire internship is insurance sales, if you succeed with that you can move up in the company, if not, then you might as well quit. Managers want to help but in the end, it\\'s up to you to succeed. Not the kind of financial job I was interested in. The best thing about this job is that it provides a great idea of what the actual career is about. The internship is almost identical to what the full time financial advisors do in a day, but it has a lot of development programs built in with it. Great starting job, gives great flexibility and balance between work and home life. Highly recommend if you\\'re good at selling. They really take the time to train you and guide you in your career. Great benefits and managers. Would recommend anyone work there who wants to get their foot in the door in this industry. Good work environment that gives you the resources to succeed, however, that is only half of the puzzle. There is a heavy reliance on your own friends and family to get you off the ground. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Typical day at work,- meeting with colleagues and clients ,- constructing financial plans ,- presenting plans to prospective clients ,- getting in touch with new clients very nice co workers. Its located in long Island. you get a hour long paid lunch break. its a small office but very originized. monday to friday work week. Phone people from 9-10 and meet people from 10-5 talking about peoples current financial plans and what can be recommended to help them be financially secure. The hardest part was setting meetings with people that didn\\'t know you as well and getting introductions to new potential clients.The most enjoyable part was making a difference in someones financial future. Great place to work. New Challenges daily. Need to passion to be successful and the desire to work hard. Be resilient and do what your told and you\\'ll be successful. NM is a great place to work!  The benefit package is top notch.  There is an onsite health care facility, workout facility and free lunches everyday.  The employees are engaged and extremely talented. The opportunity is there and the benefits are wonderful.They take part in providing free lunch to all of their employees, connecting them with their own credit union, and they have their own health services on campus. The company culture is a bit old school and can get stuffy at times. This job is all about being uncomfortable, and if you don\\'t like that, don\\'t even try. You have to start out dialing all your friends and family and then prospect out beyond them if you can. People who are part of the 10 percent who make it past five years do well, others find something else. Great company to work for career advancement. Needs more leadership training or experienced leaders. ,Company could be more diverse in people leaders. Hard work and lots of training if you are new in the career. Otherwise it has unlimited potential. This job allows you to control you own salary and your own schedule. It can be tough for unmotivated people. Everyone knows NM as a large name, serious employer. What may not be known is that even when the company is doing well, the positions are unstable, with little pay. I learned a lot about sales at this internship that prepared me for my future sales and how the corporate world works.  If you put in enough work you are able to accomplish great things at this company. it is a good place to work if you can live on commission alone.  you set your own hours and create your own meetings. must have good phone skills to keep calendar full to ensure success NM has been in the industry for a while and has a large impact on the insurance business. ,They want you to go out an sell business to your close friends and attain further referrals from them. if you cant make it past your initial networking circles than you will not make it. ,If you do get a large number of referrals and make a few sales along the way then you have potential to make a lot of money Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work. NM has a positive and motivating office culture with very friendly people. I\\'ve always experienced lots of support from management and Home Office. Classy, wholesome group of people. Great experience for the right person.  Worked with amazing people.  The goal is to connect people with a great product and if you are the right fit, it will be a good company to work for. Lots of cold calling and selling life insurance. Typical day would include trying to book meetings via cold calling. Once you actually get someone on the calendar then you can hopefully keep the meeting. If you then in turn actually keep the meeting then you have the opportunity to sell them. It is a great bank to work in they have stayed in the competition and proving themselves.the management there is good and returns most of its profit to the investors. Northwestern Mutual provided a great opportunity to gain experience in the financial services industry in a professional manner. However, the compensation was commission, thus salary was very uncertain. I loved working for this company! The people there are incredible and constantly encouraged me to meet my goals. I did extremely well with this company but felt that insurance is not something I see myself doing as a career. If you don\\'t need a manager to tell you what to do and are willing to be responsible for how much you make this is a good company. Not much training provided to new reps but good compensation if you try. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Located in Pittsburgh. I am an intern there now. There is not much growing in the company for me once i graduate. Good learning experience though and very helpful. You call people everyday and try to go to as many meetings as possible.  I learned how to communicate better and how to work with others in a different setting.  The management was very nice and helpful.  It was a fun job to have and I would recommend it to others. Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work for. They have great compensation, great benefits, and great employees. They really care about their employees. Northwestern is a Challenging, rewarding, and fun place to start or transition your career.  The training curriculum is strong and support system is awsome. A typical day includes working with new representatives on how to work with clients and develop financial plans. You will learn the ins and outs of the financial services career. Management depends on your region and location. The hardest part of the job is having to reject clients due to underwriting. The most enjoyable thing was helping people reach their dreams through financial security. The Northwestern Mutual internship program was truly a great experience. The whole recruiting team and team of Financial Advisors at the Monroeville office were very helpful and supportive. They really give you a solid foundation to be successful and it\\'s in your hands where you want to take it from there. I loved the flexibility of the work schedule and the opportunity to meet many individuals. It\\'s very rewarding knowing you\\'re helping someone achieve financial stability and security. Cant beat the free lunch. Seems most departments are sympathetic to life outside of work. Great benefits. Only worked as an intern, but my coworkers were great and everyone I met was helpful. Initially everything is based off granum, building a clientele. Most days are spend making calls to potential prospects and setting up meeting. Comprehensive analysis\\' are completed after a thorough fact finder. Management and co worker are all hard working and motivated If you ever get the opportunity to work here, do not pass it up.,You will be glad you did.,Every area of this company is amazing.,There is really nothing more to say, honestly. From the top down, Northwestern Mutual\\'s philosophy of doing what\\'s best for its clients is apparent in the decisions it makes on a corporate level and in how they select the agents that represent them in the field. The employees and management are some of the nicest people I\\'ve worked with. The work environment is very playful and energetic. The workload was very manageable during the week even with classes going on at the same time. A typical day would include calling at least ten people every day to schedule a meeting for a fact finder. Some days I would have a prospecting meeting to meet one person then get referred to other potential clients. Some days would include having a fact finder meeting where my mentor and I would sit down with a potential client and talk about individual financial plans. The hardest part of the job is calling people every day and having the motivation to do so. Getting rejections and clients cancelling at the last moment can get frustrating at times. On the other hand the most enjoyable part was knowing that I had made a positive impact on multiple individual\\'s financial goals. Everything about this company is amazing if you can stick it out long enough to push past the gruesome 100% commision struggles during your first few years. Working here offers a lot of independence and flexibility. You are constantly surrounded by like-minded people who are always willing to help you out. Everyone is very transparent, and no one is trying to step over someone else. Great atmosphere. They truely want to see you succeed, i met the most amazing people there. The only problem is that they REQUIRE you to do 10 joint work appointments a month which helps out the more experienced reps. Also if you had a client who purchased a life insurance policy from you and they decide to cancel in a span of 13 months, then your commissions will be reversed... which is horrible for anyone with a family or starting a family and needs to have stable income. I am an intern and basically just give admin support to my boss, I haven\\'t learned a lot, but the work is easy. I was thrown into the mix after I took the internship over from my friend and I was only trained for 3 hours. Northwestern mutual is divided between finance and insurance. The technology and process are outdated. It is a firm that uses the phrase \"this is how its been done, so we are going to continue doing things this way.\" An enjoyable place to work where you get the opportunity to expand your skill sets in a friendly environment that welcomes fresh ideas whether you\\'re a contractor or employee. Requires a lot of self motivation and time. You cannot expect to go into this position with out performing for your compensation. Working at Northwestern Mutual was a new experience they do a great job training and allowing you to manage yourself without having to be watched over. Overall good expierence Great environment, great people, and a great way to make a difference. Learn from one of the best insurance companies about quality customer care. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. During the interview process they really sell you on how much money you can make, and they don\\'t say anything about how boring life insurance really is. Also they fail to mention how many tests you have to pass in order to actually be qualified to do the job. During training is the most stressful thing, I literally studied for all the tests and worked on my \"approach\" to customers all day and had zero leisure time. I would work and study nonstop, I honestly hardly had time to sleep. Eventually I resigned because I don\\'t want to work more than 40 hours a week, and it really just isn\\'t my cup of tea. Oh and 100% commission is rough. From the firing process, to the benefits, to the day to day experiences, NM works to drive home employee engagement.  As a whole the company makes decisions that are the right thing to do.  They provide numerous educational and training opportunities that are the foundation of their employee improvement process.  ,The hardest part about the job is that there is always more work to do and I needed to keep the life/work balance a goal.,And yes a fee lunch lots of options. Northwestern Mutual actively works to promote financial security for their clients. As a financial representative, I saw many ways in which management was actively working to help me succeed. My only complaint was that I felt overcompensated, and my production would never be enough - even in light of my excellent record. Great place to work. Always busy and different challenges everyday. I enjoyed the different clients I worked with on a daily basis.,I learned the different types of insurance policies. ,My co-workers were team players and very helpful. You create your own schedule, have lots of accountability but need to create a book of business. Difficult for first 3 years then get better with time and returning clients. Good Place to work with. Fun and free environment. Focused company. ,Would definitely encourage new people to come and work here so that it will improve there career. Thanks. Mcdonalds as everyone should know is a very big player in the fast food market. The job I had was line cook so you had to be quick on your feet to fulfill orders. Also ability to adapt to surroundings. Typical day at work: Meeting at 7 or 7:30am. Calling people from 9am-10am. Meeting with potential clients from 10:30am-5pm. Posting your productivity from 5-6 pm. ,I learned how to educate and help others with comprehensive financial planning. (Risk management, wealth accumulation, and wealth preservation and distribution),Management was great. Very encouraging and helpful.,Hardest part of the job was finding people willing to meet with a 22 year old to talk about financial planning. ,The most enjoyable part of the job was having success with your clients and closing deals. Pure sales, nothing more. If the grind is for you then it should work out beautifully.  Locally some branches are better than others, managing directors being the difference.  Good managing director= good reps in office= good office culture= more success. My job is great. Great people. NM is wonderful to work for I am looking for part time work to supplement my income and time. Northwestern Mutual is a great company, with a great culture. I enjoy helping others plan for their future, while developing great relationships. I would recommend Northwestern Mutual as a great workplace. Good company to work for but it was on commission basis but i am looking for salary ,I received good training to obtain life and health license and passed series 6 and 63 but as i am not working so all licenses are inactive The family culture, work-life balance, benefits, management, opportunity to grow and advance through the company can not be matched!  I would recommend this company to anyone not only seeing employment but also to anyone interested in the financial products they offer.  They have been rated the top insurance company by Fortune 500 for 10+ years. it was a great place to work, great work environment, fortune 500 company, but in the end of the day commission sales just wasn\\'t for me Northwestern Mutual is a top class company. Not only are the reps well trained and managed, they have far and away the best products on the market. The culture of the company is amazing and everyone is happy to help the younger reps in any way that they can. The downfall for new reps is that if they don\\'t have a good network going in to the company, it is very hard to build one. It is crucial that people close to you will use your services or it will be very hard to survive. Those that have high net worth friends typically fare better because they are able to pull good paychecks while building their outside networks and don\\'t have to worry about not making money. I worked at NM for 9 years. I dedicated my life to this company and always received amazing yearly reviews for my hard work and dedication.  Then I experienced serious health issues for a few months that were explained to them by my doctor and was let go.  While working there, it is next to impossible to advance unless you are part of the chosen few.  Promise after promise of advancement and raises if certain goals are met, but then not honored for those achievements as promised.  Everyone is sitting on top of each other in the workspace provided with no personal space at all.  Once upon a time this may have been a great place to work, but those days are over.  Firing hundreds of employees while building a new $450M tower.  Shame on them. Job differs per each Rep in the office. You have plenty of flexibility within schedules as long as all tasks are completed. However, each representative is different and may not be as flexible. Corporation Atmosphere. Felt like family. they had great advancement opportunities. Great working teams. Incentives for high work ethics. Great benefits NM is a great company to work for, I really enjoyed my tenure and learned from my coworkers who helped me and guided me. Very friendly and professional environment. Leadership is great and helpful. I work in most visible project because it\\'s NM website.,We follow Agile methodology. That itself defines how aggressive goals are and deadlines. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. - Support vendor applications and work on new requirements.,- Take backup, restore of production database to non-production like stage and test server, login creation, give access to user etc. Partners you with veteran representatives who you work with until you both decide you are ready to do cases on your own.  Dedicated College Unit Directors who help your development with ongoing training throughout the internship. I would arrive in the morning and make sure my schedule was ready to go.  I would make my calls to my customers for the next day to make sure the appointment was still going to work for them. Flexibility scheduling outside of occasional set training meetings allowed for freedom and work flow unmatched by most any profession. Time management techniques were heavily utilized with this experience.  Team management was incorporated into finalizing sales.  Leaving proficiency in their work up to me to insure correctness in recommendations made. Northwestern Mutual is an incredible company.  Great environment, great culture, great team work. ,I would recommend this company to any pursuant. Great working culture. Insurance sales is based on who you know and how well you can hustle. Northwestern Mutual is a company is great. If you do well, they take very very good care of you. Only decided to move because of the compensation style was only commission based. It was a great work environment and kept me entertained. They provide all necessary resources. There is a lot of room for upside potential but it includes a lot of risk. I would recommend this job to anyone who has a lot of energy and the ability to talk to anyone at anytime. Good place, challenging, innovative, IT helps drive the business forward.  Overall a strong company with lots of opportunity and growth!  A place where they value the employees. Co-workers are great and pitch-in to help one another. If supervisor disagrees with you it is difficult to be heard. Things change a lot which is sometimes good but can be frustrating. NML is a great company.,Finding your niche market is what it is all about.,If you work with or for a high quality rep, then you are good.,Just make sure they are a good boss. Very structured...a lot of training and motivation from peers and management.,Beautiful office space, with very nice staff of which the majority have tenure.,You do have to adapt  to the NWM culture for maximum success.,They have to notch insurance products...,The company should at least provide a \"Starter Package\" of leads for new comers.,Other than the company not providing leads it\\'s a great company to work for. A very rewarding career if you do the things they ask of you. As a Financial Representative, you will do very well if you put the necessary time in everyday. In the early stages of your career you must work at least 8-10 hours a day to build your clientele. The most enjoyable part of this career is sitting down with people and building relationships. The management, and just the culture itself was awesome.  It is just really hard to make it if you don\\'t have a natural market.  The entire job boils down to being great on the phone, and prospecting.  If you can do those two things, you can make a great career and be compensated so well that you never have to think about money.  All you have to do is make it through the first 3 years.  Once you\\'re over that hump, it is smooth sailing.  Great company, just not the right fit for me. Working for NML was a great experience. I actually learned more about securities, life insurance policies, 401K, and money management in my short time there.  The hardest part of my job trying to decipher the intent of the sales person. Making sure they were being compliant but also verifying that they are being honest and not persuading the client to choose a certain product. The most enjoyable part was seeing how different areas of the company worked together effortlessly to find a package/product to fit each client individually. Good experience. Great for the entrepreneur. Must be ambitious and have a good network. You will gain great reward by putting in the hard work in this environment. This was a high stress job.  Everything seemed to be an emergency. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I enjoyed my direct supervisor as well.  It\\'s an overall good place to work. A typical day at work at NM consists of: preparing applications for the representatives and their clients, handling mail, inputting billing information, inventory management, preparing policies, working the front desk, answering clients\\' questions, preparing illustrations, booking meetings, and am the Secretary in our Philanthropy Committee. ,I have learned to organize my work efficiently as well as prioritize better. Also, I have learned to communicate effectively with team members and pay attention to the details. ,I enjoy working with my team- they are fun, focused, goal-oriented individuals. ,The hardest part of my job is being able to complete tasks in a timely manner, with many distractions throughout the day, and not missing details. ,The most enjoyable part of my job is having amazing mentors to work with and accomplishing tasks. Excellent company to work for with tremendous opportunity for professional development.,Management is very helpful and willing to help yo every step of the way. ,The technology provided through the company to draw up reports and presentations is very user friendly , and there is also a 24 hour employee helpline for IT Good if you have a developed network but at the end of the day it\\'s insurance and sales. It\\'s a great product but the ideal prospect is very niche. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. It\\'s a great company gained a lot of information. The perks of the Job were the freedom and awesome atmosphere ! The opportunities and possibilities are great ! It can be a really tough job to maintain because of it being 100% commission and you having to work with your natural market. Great workplace experience with amazing people. Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work for. Getting in front of thousands of people and showing them the type of work you do is a rush. Showing these people recommendations that can assist them in their financial situations is astounding. The office was a great one to work in.  I enjoyed a lot of the other employees.  It is a different culture where you have some employees who work directly for Northwestern Mutual and then others (like myself) that work for the reps individually.  I had a challenging job keeping up with his growing business, but I enjoyed that each day brought something new.  I answered phone calls, set appointments, took applications, submitted applications, delivered applications, and kept track of all applications in underwriting.  I also kept his financial books, worked with brokers, and moved all paper files to a new e-file system. Great culture.  Everyone who works there is really nice!  Pay is good.  Vacation is good.  They work with you very well if you have a family.  Other benefits not so good.  No room for growth within the office. Steep learning curve and clearly outlined expectations. Self-driven growth with lots of encouragement and incentives to succeed. Lots of phone calls. Amazing work environment and great people to work with and I would highly recommend to anyone looking at this company. Northwestern Mutual is a great company, no doubt about it.  Although I don\\'t work there anymore I still keep in touch with all my old co-workers and I still hold insurance with them, which should tell you something.  I worked there as a full-time financial rep for a year, and I enjoyed my time.  The training and support is great, but this is a commission only job, which is my only caveat and reason for leaving. They tell you their are three I\\'s in this job.  Income, Independence and Impact.  I never doubted those for one minute during my tenure at Northwestern Mutual.  They want you to live a great life, while taking care of those clients who trust you at the center of their financial lives.  I will be a lifetime client of Northwestern Mutual, but decided for my career, that I would like to explore what else is out there to grow as an individual. You must be really invested in trying to find people with money because it is a 100% commission job therefore you only make money when you sell something which is a difficult task that takes at least 2 or 3 weeks to do. Very flexible.  Set my own hours. I was able to run my own shop, hired my own people.  Was given good backing but left to do as I pleased.  Best job I ever had. Company has a great deal of talented people. Career opportunities are limited but available. Have heard rumors of layoffs coming to manage costs. If you enjoy calling people that you\\'re close to, family and friends, to ask them for referrals and business then you can succeed. It takes awhile to get going and you are only paid when you sign on clients. Great company, best products, but the pay scale is terrible.Long hours of hard work, dialing, but the income from all of that is dismal. Northwestern Mutual is a nice place to work. Employees are friendly and warm. A typical day for my work as an Administrative Assistant would be conducting the electronic filing, running errands, and keeping the work place orderly and neat for clients and other employees. Great place to work. Can be a very rewarding career if you have the ability and the drive to do it. there are many opsticles that come with this line of work I worked as an intern at this company and learned a ton from many different successful people.  They had great selling training and people with years of experience that also helped my development as a professional.  Great company overall. I worked there for almost two years and I worked with a amazing team and had many mentors to help me out! Would highly recommend to anyone looking to get into the business. Sales is not for everybody. There is no base salary only commission. It is very difficult to start and you always find yourself prospecting nonstop. Never truly stop thinking about work. There is the possibility for unlimited salary but constant sales mentality. Northwestern Mutual has been a great environment to grow in. Your mentors pay close attention to you and offer any sort of help they can. Everyone pushes you to step outside your comfort zone and work on \\'getting comfortable being uncomfortable\\'. Not only is it a great career opportunity long term, it is also such a great place to kick start your business and personal growth. You\\'re rewarded for all of your efforts and there is no cap on the amount of success you can have! First thing every morning I meet with my Financial Representative and discussed customer service issues, underwritten status, and all open cases.  Discussed upcoming appointments.  There I process applications, followed up on the status.  Answered telephones, provided customer service, and prepare all customer correspondences.  I  was responsible for all incoming and outgoing mail for the representative.  I meet with clients and complete applications or open new accounts when needed.  Calculated cost basis for clients and with preparing and process mutual fund trade request for clients.  Balanced portfolios when requested. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. This internship is unlike any other. This isn\\'t some errand running, dirty work internship. You start running your own business from the start of the internship, giving you an opportunity for unlimited income potential. You get real life experience and are able to work with some of the best people in the industry. While I respect Northwestern Mutual completely and their goals I found the organization lacking in the progressive contact center forward direction that I was seeking.  ,I appreciate the experiences I have there as I was able to learn more about the SCRUM/Agile environment and what it means to be a Product Owner.  I just didn\\'t find the overall organization one which met my career goals. The Northwestern Mutual model is a tough place to have your first job, but it is very rewarding in the sense that it forces you to be your best everyday. I enjoyed my interim work at NM. I met a lot of wonderful people and enjoyed witnessing culture shift that the senior leader is attempting. Great firm to work for, inclusive environment, commission based only, great training platform, heavily based on insurance, guided by senior representatives preparing Test Plan, Test Scenarios, preparing Manual test cases and,development of automated test cases by decomposing use cases for specific functional requirements The people who work for NWM are truly amazing. They are dedicated to doing what is right for their clients. Unfortunately, as a staff member, you are not compensated fairly or considered as important as the reps because we do not drive revenue. Not feeling appreciated or acknowledged can be rather frustrating however I have learned that\\'s just the nature of the insurance business. Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work for. Their hands-on training is second-to-none. Learning and growing potential is endless. Work hard for your money especially when starting out! - I gained a lot of knowledge about the insurance and financial world,- You are basically your own boss running your own business ,- Fellow partners were great,- The hardest part of this job is prospecting(finding your own clients),- The best part of this career is the freedom and the potential to make as much as desired Northwestern Mutual is a good place to work overall, especially in the struggling Milwaukee market. They have a great work/home balance, which is nice when you have a family. They encourage a diverse workforce and have a very positive impact on the local community. Other benefits include tuition re-reimbursement, adoption assistance and onsite healthcare.,The pay structure is a bit confusing and advancement can be tough, depending on where you want to go in the company. Not everyone is fully engaged and most of their management is not up for holding people accountable. This was no standard type internship for college credit. They will make you WORK! However they do want to see you succeed. Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work for. You never have to apologize for the work that you do, that\\'s what I\\'ve always enjoyed about it. There are opportunities for growth potential, flexible schedule, supportive coworkers and a positive atmosphere. Northwestern Mutual Internship was extremely informative.,Opportunity to obtain life, accident, and health insurance license. ,Likely to gain hands on experience conducting your own business. It was a good summer job. The people I worked with were nice. It was also a priority to keep the kitchen clean. It was a nice job that paid well for a summer job. They were very flexible when I needed to take time off. Working at the General Agent\\'s office was a delight and challenging. Selling life insurance, mutual funds, etc. In this industry, It was exciting during the height of the stock market.  It was unfortunate that with our swinging market, the industry had to change.  ,The hardest part of my job was receiving a call informing us that a client had passed away.  Processing claims for people that you were familiar with was difficult. Amazing workplace. Great work/life balance and culture within the office. Leadership team leads by example and is experienced from within. Flexibility within your schedule as a staff member but more so as an financial representative. Access to unlimited resources, top training and continuing education. Many opportunities for growth as long as your individual business is thriving and growing. By the far the best career experience I have had thus far. The most challenging, but even more rewarding career. The job came down to cold calling and late hours of begging for sales. The management were nice, but the atmosphere is very sterile and most of the business is being lost to online sales. Good luck if you go into this company because there are no sales tools available for new employees. At Northwestern Mutual you will work hard and for yourself. I learned a lot about financial planning and the money was decent. I had to work with more experienced reps on cases, which is fine, but some reps made recommendations that probably weren\\'t in the best interest of the client. Overall Northwestern Mutual is a great company. It was a very good job and got a lot of experience out of it working with other financial advisors and seeing what they do on a daily basis. The job culture was good and everyone was friendly. It taught me a lot about time management. Had to balance work with school and family and I though I did that pretty well. The opportunity is great but this business is extremely tough.  Very good place to work with high compensation for your production. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. I love the company, free food, cheap breakfast, nice and talented people. I love working for them, they provide all the tools you need and they value their employees overall a good company to work for, advancement is not based on performance.  Free lunches are given and the menu has a wide variety. I have nothing to say about this company except: LEAN MANAGEMENT DOES NOT WORK FOR PEOPLE.  You can\\'t expect to give exceptional customer service when you are a robot. Overall it is a good place to work at. They provide great mentorship so I was able to learn quickly. An opportunity to improve the experience involving clients interaction. Working in college age students with regards to our financial planning internship. The Northwestern Mutual Internship has been ranked nationally in the top 10, according to Vault, for the past 20 consecutive years. You basically create your own business within an excellent and well established company. The sales skills you learn, and the great training that they offer, gives you invaluable experience and knowledge that will forever be useful for the rest of your career. In the last 3 years NM has started to follow the path of every other company out there and implement LEAN into this mutual company.  I don\\'t believe this is the right path for this company.  Customers don\\'t care about metrics; they just want good quality answers to their questions. I fear that things will get worse before it gets better. ,All I know is that if you can\\'t get with the program (no matter how hard you try and how many times you ask for help) you will be let go; despite the years invested in the company. If you like to sell insurance this is a good place but it is based on commission. I was an intern there and it was tough to do that as a full time student The advisors /reps hold extremely high expectations a lot with little compensation or room to grow. The most enjoyable part is working with the people at this company because they are beyond amazing. Working at Northwestern Mutual taught me what is expected of a person in the work force. Being around people who are focused and driven gave me the motivation I needed to succeed at my job. managed incidents in HPSM,learned some new programs like bomgar and Endpoint Encryption,gained vpn knowledge,worked with dell technicians to fix equipment NM is a great company to work for however I think that employees should always feel appreciated at all times when they work hard. They give you the tools to succeed but you have to be prepared to put in the work 7 days a week. You need to be able to find your own leads and sometimes your referrals run out and cold calling is necessary to meet their standards. It is a good place to work. They have free lunch and the benefits are okay but not the greatest. The pay range is somewhere in the middle to low end for people who have been there for awhile but great for those just coming in. Northwestern Mutual is a great company that does right by it\\'s clients.  As a rep you have unlimited earnings potential. I gained valuable knowledge and skills when I interned at Northwestern Mutual as a Mutual Fund Accounting Analyst. This experience will strongly help me in my future career. Great company. I enjoyed working with the people here alot. But unfortunately theres is no stability income which was why I had to leave. You do have a flexible schedule which is nice but the kind of work that you do here at NWM may just take up your whole entire day. Its a tough business to be in. You have to make a sale in order to eat. ,No stability in income. Takes a special kind of person to do this job. Great company to learn a lot about insurance and investment, enhance your sales and networking skills. Company is not responsible for making sure advisors pay the benefits they promised their assistants when signing the contract, which can lower its reputation and image. In this job I worked the control center monitoring the cctv, telephone and alarm systems. Toured the property if need properred reports. Assist with the security of the employees and property. Working here has been a learning experience, with a lot of self reflection. The structure within the organization for Administrative staff is not very inclusive. There are no group benefits; everyone is employed by/for individual financial representatives. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Amazing workplace. Great work/life balance and culture within the office. Leadership team leads by example and is experienced from within. Flexibility within your schedule as a staff member but more so as an financial representative. Access to unlimited resources, top training and continuing education. Many opportunities for growth as long as your individual business is thriving and growing. By the far the best career experience I have had thus far. The most challenging, but even more rewarding career. I enjoyed the internship simply because I was actually doing what the salary members were doing as opposed of running errands. Extremely supportive group of employees, access to offices all over Tampa, strong values and integrity to its clients. Overall great work environment. free lunch is best thing at nM. Very good cafe and lunch buffet. top notch. People are little old school, I meant work culture is not great and upto date. But overall good company to work for. Northwestern Mutual is an Insurance/Investments company. This is an amazing career opportunity for anyone looking for a rewarding and challenging career. Great company with decent opportunities for advancement. I learned about types of insurance policies and underwriting guidelines.,Co-workers are some of the nicest people I\\'ve ever met. ,The hardest part of the job is the repetitiveness of the cases. the people are amazing to work with, but the work itself, I was employed for only 4 months and loaded with tons of responsibilities which I was willing and eager to learn but by that 4 month period, because I was a \"slow learner\" they said I was in over my head and no longer was going to be kept on board. It was disappointing that nobody was willing to do further training with me or help me better myself for advancing. Northwestern Mutual is a strong company with a core group of management that will continue to carry it as a AAA rated firm.  It allowed for collaboration between co-workers and held everyone to high standards.  I enjoyed the challenge of establishing a marketing platform for a business that doesn\\'t typically focus on such marketing efforts, and seeing the firm\\'s numbers increase as a result of this was a rewarding feeling. 1. Typical Day: Hustling to gather leads ,2. What you learned: Your only as good as the last assignment you finished.,3. Management: Not a reliable source to gain knowledge from,4. Your Co-Workers: Everyone is on edge all the time,5. The hardest part of your job: You are always on your toes ,6. Most enjoyable part of the job: Knowing the end results produced a happy client. I very much enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual. The managing director and managing partners did an excellent job of educating their employees and the the overall atmosphere was one of support and teamwork. The company does a lot to help new agents build their practice. Great place to work. Employee are given proper training. The supervisors and managers are very forthright with responsibilities for employees. I worked for an outside agent\\'s office. They were extremely qualified and great employers. If the office location were closer to home, the job would have been almost ideal. Commute time was over 2 hours per day. Office did not offer benefits. An awesome company with excellent training and mentors.A typical day at Northwestern Mutual would require a weekly meeting in the morning, time set aside for phoning leads, and also time meeting with clients. I loved all of my coworkers and I had the luxury of being under the tutelage of some great mentors. very energetic career,very goal oriented ,commission based pay,on the run,need to be able to sell insurance,prospect,internship was fun Was a very educational and motivating place to work. Leadership was very open and encouraging. The training process was the best I have ever been through. Left this company with nothing but good feelings to have been a part of it, As a financial representative you have a lot of freedom and the ability to plan your career around your personal life and obligations. The education they provide is top notch and continuous. Management is supportive and helpful, and has your best interest in mind. The hardest part of the job is self motivation. If you are not a self starter this is not the place for you. Is a solid place to work, decent pay, great culture. Learned how to work with clients and how technology can benefit them. Good job I really enjoy it.  I liked the people and the staff.  You have to learn to cold call, and build a book of buisness. Great job, amazing people. I have nothing but great things to say about Northwestern Mutual. It is a triple-A rated company that puts the clients first. I was not interested in selling life insurance,cold calling all day long ,manager was not helpful,coworkers were nice however not willing to assist ,cold calling all day,learning about new products Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. No screaming no yelling - quietest place I have worked at.  Nicely organized but too many hoops to jump thru to get things done. Being a college financial representative with Northwestern Mutual was a challenging, but rewarding internship. I learned a variety of different opinions, sales techniques, and overall financial information. The toughest part of the internship was reaching out to potential clients even though I was not from the area. The best part of this internship was the people that I got to meet and all of the financial information and tips that I learned from experienced professionals. I learned a lot about interpersonal skills and the insurance market. It was a great experience and I highly recommend it to others. The management team was excellent and helpful, although I did not know the correct people in Bozeman to make the job work. It is a good place to work. Requires you to be focused and competitive. Nice people work there who support and help you. Management is strict yet helpful. Hard to call lots of people everyday. I was the front face of the Company. I greeted clients, made sure they felt welcomed. I did anything from that to inputting client information, managing the office calendar as well as the managing directors calendar. As a student, you are required to attend a weekly meeting at 7:30 AM and a small group coaching session. That isn\\'t asking too much, but you also have to call as many people as possible and set outside meetings weekly or you were considered as \"failing\" at requirements. Taking on a full semester and spending countless hours trying to call, pester, and beg for meetings for $100 a week just didn\\'t add up for me. Not to mention, once you finally sold a policy, it took weeks for you to ever see any of the money. So if you are trying to pay for rent and go to school, you need a second job that pays $10 an hour. I found that Northwestern Mutual is a very honest company and do take very good care of their clients. However, I do not feel that they really take too much care about their employees unless you are the top 3 producers of the firm. At least where I am at in the Capital area.  I am not sure how it is at other firms but the atmosphere was great for the most part.  But the support from upper management seemed to be lacking.  Overall, I understand.  To rid the company of the lower producers to make room for more, but that shows in the high attrition rate. ,People are being interviewed everyday and it just seems more like a churning machine rather than a solid and secure place to work.  ,Long work hours and constant expenses to the office leave you working a lot and getting paid less than you think you will be at first, but after 5 years average the numbers will tell you that it begins to pay off.  Although they tell you this upfront, they also empower you to believe that you can break the mold.  Which many have, but most, don\\'t.,Overall a great company, but I think you can easily find better employee appreciation/compensation elsewhere. I worked at the Franklin location. Training is not the best its rushed and they have everything scheduled bc it was a high turnover dept. calls were back to back, training was not thorough. Insurance is like $300 mo. They like to make improvements, but not so much implement new things when it causes a change they like to keep their structure. For ex. In training we tried to suggest a review the next morning a short one, but that was asking too much of them. Its a 6 month training program i would have imagined it being through.,The company itself was great it promoted to see the best in each other, promoted positivity and recognizing efforts. Great company, great people, hard to move around if you don\\'t know other people. I love it here, just want to learn more. The company has really great benefits and promotes good health. It\\'s a great company with free lunches and various clubs that you can join. But it is changing and some areas of the company is based on favoritism. Very New to the position that I was in and overwhelmed at first. Working 5 days a week wasn\\'t ideal for my nursing school schedule. Otherwise, an easy desk job. This internship was very helpful to me as it pushed me far out of my comfort zone. I learned that you can\\'t always stay in your comfort zone to advance in this world. My job consisted of calling friends and family and other referrals to try to set a meeting with them to discuss the products that the company offers. Being a financial representative is definitely not one of the easiest jobs out there.  Each day brings a new set of challenges to deal with, however everyone there is willing to give you advice and help you succeed in any way they can. I really enjoy working for Northwestern Mutual. There is never a moment when you are without the support you need in order to do your job to the fullest of your ability. ,I have a great boss, and work with a really great/supportive team of people. ,I truly believe in the company and feel it\\'s easy for me to convey that message to the people I\\'m trying to bring in. Great company to work for but you have to know where you are going and know how to get things done. This is a kind of job that your willing to work for The best part of the job was the work, I enjoyed my job responsibilities but did not have much respect for any of the 4 managers I had while I worked there and felt my coworkers were among the laziest I have ever worked with in my 30+ years in computer operations. Collaborated with clients to identify financial goals, establish a plan and monitor their assets. Through customer centered service, I was able to connect with incredible clients and make a lasting impact on their lives. Northwestern Mutual was a great places to work. They provide extensive training for sales and financial advising skills. A high tempo work environment with the ability to develop your own business model. At NW you\\'ll have the opportunity to earn certified skills and take multiple different test to get certified such as the security exams for financial advising. The Northwestern Mutual, Buffalo Office encouraged an environment that was supportive of every intern\\'s hopes and aspirations along with challenging them to reach outside of their comfort zones in order to grow as professionals managing their own businesses under Northwestern Mutual. Incredible fun work environment. Independent schedule. Hardest part was picking up the phone when you are in a slump and no one is answering. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Great Company! NML has been around for over 155 years.This Company and Fidelity Investments are excellent companies to work for! Northwestern Mutual is a great company to be backed by.  They have an excellent training program. If you like to work hard, can handle rejection, and be your own boss then i recommend you try it out. Working at Northwestern Mutual has been enjoyable, getting to know the variety of Financial Advisors and the products available to clients. Advised clients on the benefits of estate planning and other investment opportunities.,Sold life insurance, disability insurance, and was a key member in promoting business prospects. All Commission and while the rates are good, it is tough to get going. Need to rely on family and friends to get started, which can be awkward when starting up. Very strong company financially and culturally.  We do things the right way, always in the clients best-interests.,Typical day is a combination of responding to client requests, tracking investment accounts, maintaining fiduciary responsibility, prospecting actively to new business partners, markets, and owners.,The hardest part of the job is getting clients to take action on their own goals.,The most enjoyable part of the job is when they DO take action on their own goals.  It means they\\'re going to make it!,Management is fantastic, very supportive and knowledgeable. Great upper management that really wants to watch you succeed in the business. The benefits of the job reflect the amount of effort you put into the job. You have certain benchmarks to reach, but are free to work at the pace you want with your own leads. We dial from 9am to 10:30am. After that our time is dedicated to appointments that we have booked for that day. A day at work is very smooth with a comfortable environment. I have learned to manage my time and how to build a holistic financial plan for someone. The management was very helpful and was always there when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with all different types of people, but the hardest was actually setting those appointments with those people. With Northwestern Mutual and The Glenn Black Group team it is a win - win for a place to build a financial practice.  Strong Leadership and great products, compensation, benefits, flexible schedule have afforded my family comfort. The above three words express all that I feel about Nymex Capitol.,Like all IB positions, its a lot of work and sometimes long hours but in the process, you learn so much and become good at valuation and Analysis of companies.,If Financial analysis is not your thing, I can see how somebody would be so frustrated and tired. I only worked at northwester mutual life insurace company as an intern for a little less than 2 month. As an intern the working environment is very sit back and relax. Great insurance but the rest is limited. Commission only,good training, good systems, slow tech and limited investment choices. Expectations are extremely high but it can be very rewarding. This company is not for everyone. This job will make you think bigger but 100% commission has its pros and its cons. Good foundation to learn financial planning and advising platform. Good base for sales skills if effort applied. mentor a must if you plan to succeed. Northwestern Mutual is a well-established and respectable financial firm.  Business owners and regular individuals trust and rely their hard earned money to be managed by trusty-worthy and qualified financial representatives and advisors. The firm helps ordinary people protect their families for life\\'s unexpected circumstances. Being contracted for Northwestern Mutual is a demanding yet rewarding career opportunity.,A typical day will last from 7:30a to 7:30p for newer financial representatives.  Dialing prospects to schedule meetings takes place from 9a to 10a. I have learned much about the insurance and financial industry in my time with Northwestern Mutual studying for the Life/Health Insurance exam and preparation for the Series 6 FINRA exam.  The office is located in Grandview Yard and has a wonderful view of downtown. Colleagues are all very friendly and willing to help.  As a new representative, they recommend that a majority of the meetings you take be done with a joint work partner so that you have added benefit of and expert alongside.  ,The work-life balance can be challenging at times. As a financial representative, you are building your own business.  This work is time consuming and can be rather stressful. Income is based on a decision that prospective clients make to incorporate a product or service that Northwestern Mutual offers.  This is a not a fee based planning firm. Great company to work for, the people are smart, encouraging and respectful. I love sales and I\\'m seeking an opportunity that involves more of the arts, retail fashion, or creative type field. This is a tough industry and a hard job, but the more work you put in to building your business the better you will do. it is a commission only business but because of that there is an unlimited earning potential. You also get to help people with real problems and risks in tier lives. Very hard job to do, but can be very rewarding. Not always a reliable source of income. Not the best environment for someone who doesn\\'t have discipline to work everyday. If you are going to work in this industry, this is the company to do it with. They expect results, but they give you all of the necessary tools. It can take a great deal out of you if you aren\\'t prepared for the endless phone calls and rejections. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. This specific location was very lenient when it came to scheduling which is both great but also very bad. With out much guidance you are thrown in blind and need to hustle to get new clients. Although everyone who worked there was very friendly and seemed like a little family, it was hard coming in when you aren\\'t referred by a current employee. Your day will be calling prospective for a few hours then setting up meetings and going out to meet with them. What they need to do during the interview is reiterate that it is solely based off commission. My boss created his own schedule and set up meetings with clients on his own time. I strived to work under a similar situation. Working at Northwestern Mutual taught me how to be effective with time management, customer relationship management, and sales. The support I received from my boss and my co-workers allowed me to become the most effective new intern for the summer out of a group of 6. Great company to work for if you enjoy the sales process.  Great working environment and almost total control over daily schedule.  Eat what you kill mentality, completely commission based pay.  If you make a lot of sales,  you will make a lot of money.  If you do not make sales, you do not get paid. Early stages of career focus on life and disability insurance sales which can be a challenging market for a young college graduate. only the best , most persistent, and goal oriented people make it to working one year here. once you have your client base then it all begins to fall into place. As a Financial Representative at Northwestern Mutual I met with individuals, families, and businesses in the Sacramento area and helped them mitigate risk, accumulate wealth, and plan long term. NWM was a fun work environment. Although the work was somewhat difficult, the atmosphere kept the employees going. We also had various speakers come in to further motivate us. Typical day was 9-5.,I learned the importance of money management and so much more.,My co-workers were very knowledgeable and helpful in any situation.,The hardest part of the job is getting into contact with a client to sit and meet with you.,The most enjoyable was filling the client with very useful information. all commission,balance with work/life,provides you with your intentional lifestyle,love the people I work with,nights/weekends Extremely fast paced environment. Commission based salary made for long weeks with no pay. Management was spectacular. Great place to get your feet wet in the industry as well as the professional workplace. Keeps you extremely busy inside and outside of work. Always either working on or in your practice. People were great, however there was major room for improvement in the culture of the office. Possibly the best career for certain individuals but very difficult to make it in the first few years. Great career but wasn\\'t for me Small local group who did landscaping work within metro Detroit areas. Learned to do blue collar work in a team environment efficiently. Though this was a temporary job until we moved from IL to AZ, I was able to pick up the responsibilities quickly and perform the job without any micro-managing. ,I was well like and perform the job well. The previous employee in this position did not perform well so I received many compliments. In fact, if we had stayed in IL, they would have offered me a full-time position at their firm. Overall it was a great experience just wasn\\'t the right job for me. It requires a high degree of salesmanship. I unfortunately do like sales. if you have the personality for it then you will excel. Treats employees well and provides industry leading benefits. It is a huge local employers that pays high wages and provides daily free lunch to all employees.  However, the corporate structure is ridged. Collaboration et apprentissage avec les conseillers financiers comfirmés de l\\'entreprise. Vente de services, marketing, formation d\\'une clientèle particulière. This was a great learning experience, however I was not as effective because of the extreme reliance on one\\'s own market.  We had to contact everyone we knew in our warm market to set up meetings and hopefully turn them into clients. I did not like the sales part of the job. Northwestern Mutual is a great insurance company. The people I worked with were very good people but they wanted me to be a life insurance salesman and that\\'s not a good fit for me. I wanted to be a financial advisor or financial analyst and that is not what they needed. A great experience but not a good fit. Learned a lot here, good amount of trail by fire.  Work environment is fun and laid back. Management is good and technology is on the cutting edge due to technology leadership. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. Northwestern Mutual is a great company for the right people.  Unfortunately, those who really want to be creative and think outside of the box do not fit.  The \"NM Way\" is still very bureaucratic and rigid and is not aligned with the agile pace of business today.  There are so many great things this organization has, but the day to day employee experience is one of total conformity and that does not cultivate creative thought. Northwestern Mutual is very good at management and understanding of working with youth and younger population.,There was a lot of turn over and thus lack of understanding of procedures and processes throughout the organization.  ,Majority of the staff was very positive and encouraging. Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work and grow your business as a Financial Advisor.,Their training and skill development is top notch! The company does a great job of rewarding hard working, loyal employees. Trips to Mexico and Napa. Summer concerts every year including Tim McGraw and Earth,Wind and Fire! They show loyalty to employees and clients who believe in their brand. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you have helped make people aware of the need for the products Northwestern offers.  It is definitely a delayed gratification but it makes you feel good knowing you have helped a family or individual get started on the right path. Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. Regardless how well you performed and made improvements, it never seemed enough. More work was given without training but you must come up with your own procedures while learning the job or Management would implement the PIP initiative for poor work progress.  The workload is quite heavy with little acknowledgement making day-to-day projects a chore and very stressful.,Illness isn\\'t acceptable and if you had a chronic illness and had FMLA, this seemed a strike against you for no performing your job consistently - invoking the PIP Process. You learn valuable information and skills that you would not be exposed to in a classroom setting. It requires you to get out of your comfort zone and approach people with confidence in your abilities to benefit them. It is mostly sales, but if you are good with that you will reap many benefits. This job offers an amazing opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the financial services industry. There is unlimited potential to earn commission and no cap to possible earnings. It is a competitive sales environment that will push employees to be smarter, better, and more motivated than ever before. I spent my days planning multiple philanthropic pursuits and/or client appreciation events, as well as managing multiple philanthropic tasks along with administrative duties. Working in this particular setting was pleasant, professional and challenging.,The most enjoyable part was re-establishing skills that combine a \"selling\" attitude with a chance to meet personal daily goals and be a part of a team that really worked together. It\\'s soul crushing, it\\'s gut wrenching, it\\'s tireless, thankless work, but the paycheck is steady and you\\'ll have more management than you\\'ll know what to do with. Welcome to the world of long term contract IT helpdesk work.,Contracting can be a great way to get into a field and a company, but with a company that runs a 50/50 contractor/employee workforce there are some fine print issues you always want to be aware of.,The fine print of this position: You won\\'t be a real employee so benefits will be gained through your contracting agency and can be near nonexistent. You won\\'t be a real employee so you won\\'t get to take part in the company\\'s culture, or team building exercises. Advancement will be all about networking, but you need to focus on getting converted first, which can be very hard depending on how the company likes to manage their contract workforce. The work is demanding and you\\'re kept to a much stricter set of metrics. You won\\'t be learning or exercising new skillsets that have real world application. If you need time off, it will be a struggle, as will gaining raises. You\\'ll have team leaders, department heads, support leads, and of course your contracting firm management, balancing all the management and management styles can be very tricky, as well as trying to navigate how to please them all, while delivering world class service, but don\\'t worry though some of them might not even remember your name most days...,I know my review can make it seem rather off putting, and if I had to go back and do it all over again, I would do something different, but the, experiences won\\'t be all bad. Your contracting company is your greatest ally and resource. Having worked through Adecco I can tell you that the manager they had at NM was amazing and always helpful. The work will be steady, and if you are disciplined after you lost your motivation in your downtime (which there may be a lot of) you can learn a lot. You\\'re always meeting new people, the revolving doors are more than just literal, this is great especially if you use it as a chance to focus on networking and client/employee relations. Any new skills that you will need to learn will come with some sort of training. In an IT environment you\\'ll be able to practice adnauseum any base level skills (not core principles, though).,If you\\'re looking to get into IT support, I think contracting helpdesk is a great place to get your start. You will learn the basics, and you will be so practiced that these skills will assist you throughout your career. However if you\\'re looking to really get into the inner workings of IT support, you\\'ll need to work very hard to master them, and practice them, because a long term contract on a helpdesk means more call handling, metric meeting, and management juggling, than it does any type of technical support. This is a decent company which exhibits average levels of advancement.,This company is great in the sense that they sponsor and pay for most licenses within the financial industry.,Con is that the company is mainly focused on selling insurance related products. NM has, by far, been the best work experience I have had in my short 20 years. They foster an amazing culture whose basis is rooted in development. If they take care of their employees half as well as they do their interns, you are in for a great time! I was an intern with Northwestern Mutual. They are the best insurance company in the Nation. They really cared about how I was doing, and the relationships I was making with my clients. Compensation was good, but based off commission. But, they train you and make sure you are ready to sell insurance products. I have worked as a contractor at NML over the last 10 years and have always enjoyed my assignments. I was a member of the testing services group and found that my input to process changes, innovative techniques, and developing new testing methodologies was solicited and respected by my colleagues. I worked in a variety of domain spaces including Managed Investments, New Business, Life, Personal Planning, etc.,I found people to be very dedicated to their jobs, were willing to help, friendly, and fun. 9 out of 10 Reps in this company will fail. Expect to have your own leads and if you can\\'t sell permeant life insurance then do not expect to make enough money worth the work. Great company and products....terrible leadership and model to succeed. Learn a lot about the life/health/accident insurance industry,Developed a network of five clients through phoning and in person  Engaged meetings with prospects/clients through joint work Participated in case studies on potential client interests ,Licensed Life, Accident & Health Producer for the state of CT High turnover in this position because its very demanding and wages are low for the amount of work required. No incentive for reps to want to stay in position. Great-West Financial pays their reps almost $2/hr more for this same position. Northwestern Mutual has given me great sales experience, multitasking skills, improved my work ethic, and also enhanced my knowledge in life accident and health insurance Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. As much as I thoroughly enjoyed the management and the clients I was able to speak with, I did not enjoy the representatives I worked for. They made promises that were never kept, manipulated me because of my age and lack of experience and showed they really did not care. be ready to call all of your friends and family trying to sell life insurance. zero leads are given to you. no benefits. management is nice and you will learn a lot but not for everyone The job is as fulfilling as one makes it. The company has a great reputation, but, sometimes, lacks the support that would have been highly valuable. They are also, somewhat, limited in their offerings. Certainly not everyone is capable of doing this line of work but seeing those that did well and made it a career was fun!  Lots of great experience and knowledge of the industry.  I think their core products are still great Northwestern Mutual is a place for productivity and results, although compensation may not be as desired, the culture is strong I would start off my day with a development meeting or a mentoring meeting. Then block off an hour and a half to call prospects to schedule a face to face meeting. I would then go see anywhere between 3 to 5 people daily to help create financial security for them. Utilizing my finance background and training I would educate the prospects, get to know their goals and where they stand currently, go back to my team and create a detailed financial plan for them. At the second meeting the prospect would then decide whether they would like to implement any of the insurance and investment recommendations and become a Northwestern Mutual client. I enjoyed creating my own schedule, but also didn\\'t like the uncertainty that came with it. Co-workers were fun to work with and collaborate with. Overall work was the same everyday, however varied with specifics. NM is a very strong company with a good history. Tough industry to penetrate but it has a very rewarding upside if you stick around. fun and great, wonderful people and had a wonderful time working with cathy centracchio,Intern was short and wished it was longer , day consisted of helping people with their small day to day problems.,I loved every aspect of the job. Northwestern Mutual is the high end Life insurance provider and as an agent I had extensive training on product line and how to determine proper product placement for each client. Very fast pace schedule required to ensure your income continued to climb as least through the first 5 years as an agent.,Great career for one able to dedicate a lot of time to the benchmarks set by your DM. Lack of communication and job delegation. The company is experiencing growing pains so you end up working well beyond your job description. Vacation time and benefits are great, the culture is great but very clicky, employees get promoted/ retained on a biased scale of who is best friends with the management. NM is a very professional, respectable company.  They put the needs of their clients first and offer excellent customer service.,They have the best training program for new reps and even continuing education for employees. Very fast paced environment since I was working for a top-producing agent.  Resources were good if I had any questions or needed to learn a new product.  There was not much advancement for positions like mine in the company though.  And it made motivation tough.  But the most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers. First class people, organization, and environment! One of the best if not the best work environment to be apart of and experience, Tons of room to grow, very supportive of furthering education as well as professionally. I love this company it is just not for everyone. I think that is you apply yourself anyone can do well but not everyone wants to work that hard. Loved my time at Northwestern Mutual. The office I was at really promoted mentorship and further education and was extremely supportive in all things. Northwestern has historically been known for their Life Insurance products, however they have been moving more and more into financial planning, which was a great surprise to me. However, at the end of the day this role is a sales job based on moving insurance. Compensation is great if you work hard. If you don\\'t, you wont be around long because you only eat what you kill. Professional, Best Training Available, and Independence. If you are willing to work hard, meet lots of people, and do really well then this is a great opportunity. Truly the best financial planning company out there today. My time at this job was ok but the management gave to chances to advancement all thought I learned a lot but my time was very stressful i would not ever reapply to this company. I love this company, just in a money crunch and can\\'t  fathom not being able to not know when I will be financially secure. Everything else is amazing. i was at a branch that was run terribly, management types that i would never associate myself with again.  not a place that was fun or interesting to work at. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. all contract workers - transient employees- lack of management,learned new CRM system,typical day was phone support,hardest part of job little to no breaks Great place to work with motivating individuals all around, guiding you in the appropriate way to help achieve your best Great places to work very educational plenty opportunities. Very involved in the community great management friendly coworkers. Northwestern Mutual has been an amazing company to work for. They have amazing benefits for their employees and treat everyone with the utmost respect. I sad to leave but wanted to pursue something different. Ongoing training is second to none. They really give you the tools to succeed. Company does a great job at marketing itself. The day begins with printing out company mail of the prior day\\'s submissions and distributed to various financial reps and their associates. Submissions for input are given throughout the day ending at 4pm. I learned that flexibility is a key factor in working with people and satisfying the needs of the client. Working as a team is important because the desired goal, which is having a satisfied client, is achieved in an timely and professional manner. Having satisfied clients is the most enjoyable part of the job. The client\\'s satisfaction will cause the people they know to want to do business with this company. My experience at Northwestern was great. If I didn\\'t have personal problems, I would still be there. I worked in the restaurant and I felt like I was among family from day one. The co-workers were very helpful in training me.  The employees in several departments were friendly and considerate. Northwestern Mutual is a very professional place that is driven to make clients feel comfortable and informed. A comfortable office where you always have room for growth. A typical day at NM starts at approx. 7am with the day stretching for as long as you wish it to be. You have complete control of your schedule; after all, you manage your own business. ,I had the immense opportunity to work alongside some of the highest producers within the Northwestern Mutual network. I gained a wealth of experience, predominantly in sales, but also developed a strong work ethic, and learned how to do well in a highly demanding work atmosphere. This was a nice place to work. People were very friendly and helpful. They had a steady client base and were very knowledgeable with their financial planning advice. its your own business and everything falls upon you, you need to always be cold calling and pretty much expect not to be paid. The McTigue Financial Group, part of Northwestern Mutual, is an excellent work environment where I consistently feel valued and inspired to maintain a level of excellence.,Management at this office is highly-professional but very relate-able.  During my time here I have volunteered to redesign the company\\'s website and after demonstrating that I understood the development program, received encouragement and compensation for this project.  This company is able to recognize talent within it\\'s staff and rewards accordingly.  ,A challenging part of my job involves maintaining consistent communication with many individuals throughout my agency about hiring and termination practices, as well as licensing requirements.  Overall, however, I enjoy these interactions as it enables me to help others with their hiring and licensing needs. I was responsible for developing a network and building my own insurance practice over the summer in Fort Lauderdale.  I joined the South Florida Group, and at the end of the summer, I was ranked #14 nationally in the Northwestern Mutual internship program. Worked as a freelancer, employees do receive great benefits, there is free lunch, the company takes part in a lot of community events, co-workers are very friendly. It was a great experience for someone starting their business. You have a lot of ability to grow if you put in the time. You get in what you put out if you aren\\'t willing to work this isn\\'t the job for you. Day to day I would input data for the company as well as complete any tasks asked of me by other coworkers. I was the assistant and basically did whatever was needed around the office. I would answer phones, file, make billing books, take notes during meetings, and run errands.,I learned how to work their system and enter data properly. I also learned how to file properly. It gave me a good first taste of an office environment and how to conduct myself around business clients.,Management was not very personal with me and I was never able to speak to him directly. My supervisor was a wonderful woman who was always willing to help me with anything I needed though. ,Some of my coworkers were great people and I made some long lasting friends. However, a lot of the other people working their made me feel uncomfortable.,The hardest part of my job was the slow environment and often times not having  much to do all day long. I like to stay busy and have work.,The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to learn how the office environment works and how to conduct myself professionally. Northwestern Mutual dominates in their industry.  However, beginning in sales anywhere requires right timing, a market, and proper resources.  Without having any one of those three things it will be hard to succeed. Working here is great except for the way management handle sensitive situations. The politics take over the decency of the place. There is no base salary.  They want to to call on friends and family to sell and then when you leave they hound those poeple.  they expect a young college grad to spend all their money traveling everywhere. My internship at Northwestern Mutual in Charlotte NC provided wonderful training and tools.  Productivity was entirely up to each individual financial advisor.  The more you prospected, networked, and dialed, the more meetings you would set which would ultimately result in more sales.  I was among the top 3 interns out of a class of 14 and I was aggressively recruited for a full time position. I acquired great experience from this role, but I want to transition to a role that is salary based instead of commission. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Northwestern Mutual. Great working environment with tools available for a successful and prosperous career. I worked in the application input department, so I don\\'t know how it is working for other departments. Application input was very repetitive and made the days seem so long. Management was more concerned about the numbers than their employees. I highly doubt people would have noticed if I didn\\'t show up one day. Overall, working for Northwestern Mutual was great. Obviously as a Financial Representative it is a very time consuming job, but they train you well and treat you like a professional from the first day. Outstanding people and financial products. Great learning experience to supplement professional classroom education for licensed attorneys and CPAs. It was a learning experience as I was an intern. Learned a lot about the sales and marketing side of business. Great mentorship program and you can thrive if you are good at sales. Fun fast paced environment, coworkers work closely together.,No late nights or weekends which is a plus. Busy office and professional The internship through NM was a very interesting learning experience. The ability to create your own schedule and a vast flexibility in your day to day routine was phenomenal. This also added a lot of pressure on yourself, as if you were not performing up to standards, it was generally your own fault. The materials provided to learning the products were sufficient, however it seemed very brand oriented. The compensation structure was very poor, especially if you planned on converting full time. There is no sort of base salary for people coming out of school, which really puts you through some financial stress in comparison to some other financial firms which offer up to three years of a small base salary. Strictly commission driven does not guarantee your job security or growth, and it seems to be really churn and burn oriented; aka you will most likely not see the people you have a month or two ago. Very production number oriented, as you announce your productivity numbers for the week in front of colleagues and managers. Also you have a desk fee when you go full time, which can be upwards of $300 a month. Training is excellent. Work environment is excellent. Surrounded by great motivated and encouraging coworkers and mentors. However, you are judged on activity which is generated by phone calls. No cold calls. But your entire business is referral based. So, if your not generating a phone list.. you\\'re not generating high activity. You only get paid when you sign clients. So know how to budget your money. if you need or are looking for a weekly pay check.. you\\'re not going to get it here. Expect once a month pay. Need to find leads from your own network only and effectively multitask many aspects of the business. Typical day is calling a minimum of 40 of your own contacts, setting 5 appointments, having 5 meetings scheduled for the day and keeping at least 3 of them. Check emails to follow up with applications and underwriting to obtain any additional information or forms needed, and obtain it from your client. ,First 2 years involve frequent coaching to ensure you are gaining 10 new clients per week, and are on pace to hit targets by effectively managing all aspects of your practice. Very flexible schedule, learned great communication skills both written and verbal. The hardest part of the job was trying to talk finances with people in your \"natural market\" (friends, family, etc.) lots of cold calling, good pay if youre willing to work, unlimited days off, but no money if you dont work. good staff, good management, good motivation Northwestern Mutual Life is a supportive and productive workplace that pushes for hard work, quality of life, accountability and teamwork. Managers and long time members take pride in professionalism and intentional training. I loved the job, just didn\\'t like the environment. Free lunch but short breaks. The hardest part of the job was staying focused while having to sit all day. Great place to break into the insurance business, but if you don\\'t work hard you won\\'t get paid. Great training for a first time internship Difficult to get up and running if not originally from area.  Great opportunity to succeed long term if you grind out first few years. can really be a great job. Reps don\\'t tend to provide their employees with the same benefits the try to sell their clients. Be sure to  find out compensation, bonus and benefits and get it  in writing. Northwestern was an awesome company, the best training and resources a company can offer. Their internship program will put you ahead of your peers going into any industry in corporate america. The support and tenure of your co-workers and staff is unparalleled. The cons to Northwestern are the commission levels and the constant chase for the next big deal for the first 5 years of your career. Come into work at 7:30 have meetings with mentors and go over problems during the week and plans for the week.  Training was once a week on Fridays.  Learned how to construct a sound financial plan for individual people to cater to their specific needs and goals.  Management was great and relaxed, but very professional. very difficult job to get up and running. but top tier training and a great support team will hope you along the way. they show you how easy being a financial rep can truly be but only if you develop daily habits and stick to them A great company to work with, that provided mentors to guide you on your personal practice. However, personal network does matter to an extent in order to build your practice. Great company to grow..,Got many opportunities to get my hands on various platforms..,Wonderful to work on different and challenging tools and technologies. If you are interested in sales or a financial field, this is a great company to work for. They have great resources and training tools to make anyone into a great salesman. Working for Northwestern Mutual taught me how enjoyable as well as difficult running your own business can be.  Learning from senior representatives on a daily basis was imperative.  By learning and implementing the same methods from my peers helped with learning how to figure out the needs of our clients.  ,Typical day at work involved was getting into the office before 8 have meetings with other representatives as well as our management and go through our goals for the week on a daily basis.  Afterward, call potential clients to possibly set up appointments, and go to other appointments that have been scheduled throughout the day.  It was constantly running from place to place but it was very enjoyable at the same time. I learned a lot about insurance policies and how to identify prospects needs. Management was not helpful. Co-workers were basically non-existent. The hardest part of the job was learning everything on my own and having to apply what I learned to real life. NWM provided little to no assistance while studying for insurance license. Not very many things were enjoyable about this job. I feel so lucky to enjoy where I am and the people I work with at NM.  I enjoy working in an independent environment where I am not micromanaged and feel supported. Great being surrounded by smart, hardworking individuals.  It definitely is a challenging career, but people truly want others to succeed.  I probably start work earlier than most my friends, but that is something that attracts me to our culture. A typical day at work includes administrative work before hours, phoning until 10am, and client meetings for the rest of the day.  I learned how Northwestern does their comprehensive financial planning as well as insurance sales.  Everyone at the company is great to work with and it feels like a family environment even at the agency level.  The hardest part of the job is networking and finding new clients.  Building up a book of business is incredibly difficult unless you have a large network that trusts you from the beginning. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to help people reach their financial goals on a daily basis. The career growth with the company is great and there are a lot opportunities. You can learn a lot from the training and mentor-ship. ,Definitely a great place to work if you want to move up quick and have the entrepreneur spirit. It was a great experience to work as a substitute teacher.  I really learned a lot about myself and how well I can handle adversity and different challenges.  I had to rely on myself greatly to understand the regular teachers guidelines, etc. I enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual. I enjoyed learning many new things and being apart of such a productive atmosphere. You\\'ll either sink or swim fairly quickly.  You will also know if this is for you within the first two months.  Great experience for learning how to cold-call and introduction to sales. Agents have are very temperamental especially when they don\\'t get things their way with clients. Often times when things are good they\\'ll leave you alone and let you do your work. But when they go bad for the agent they will take it out on the staff. A typical day for me included answering numerous emails and phone calls from both clients and representatives. I learned to manage my time well, as my day was constantly interrupted by client phone calls. The most challenging part of my job was keeping up with the constantly changing work environment, as staff members were not given a lot of warning. The most rewarding part of my job was being able to make a positive impact on the lives of clients who called out of desperation; they often thought they were out of options with their policies and I really enjoyed being able to find a solution for them and help ease their situation. NW Mutual in Fort Lauderdale has a great environment with a good team in the office.  Growing in the company is dependent on your willingness to work and put in the time and effort.  The ceiling is unlimited in you can be successful. I truly enjoy working here!  Everyone is super nice, and there is zero \"drama\" in the work place.  However, I have zero benefits which is because I work for a Financial Representative. This company allows individuals to make the most of their career.  Training is given and the rest is up to the employee.  Great history of the company and strong values allow for a great company to work for. A very difficult job for someone who cannot handle stress, objection, but unlimited financial potential, and unlimited ability to help people. I worked at Northwestern Mutual for an internship during college.  The best part about this internship is getting real, hands-on experience with people while digging in to their financials.  The hardest part of the job was the training and support.  Since this business runs off of commission, the employees working with the interns had to balance our training with their own clients. no income ceiling, 100 commission, schedule flexibility, can lose sleep, but you get out what you put in. they will feed you on the fact that you are a business owner but your not I enjoyed the 9 years that I worked there.  I got to know a lot of good life agents and like the Northwestern products.  Their hours were flexible and there was a lot of autonomy. Hands on, real life financial practice with compensation. Excellent eye opening internship for students who think they are going to work in finance. I had always wanted to be a Financial Representative, but I learned with this internship that it wasn\\'t for me. Valuable internship with valuable skills to be learned Sales rep for company to sell Life Insurance to personally built network. Lots of cold calling and rejection. Great support from within company when help was needed.'"
